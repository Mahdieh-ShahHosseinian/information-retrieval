 python json github filter Share Follow asked 16 mins ago ASTAST 911 silver badge88 bronze badges 1 What you've posted does not represent valid JSON. Once you've fixed that you'll need to decide which key(s) refer to a customer name. It's not obvious. Also, the "values" key has values of both string and a list of strings. That's perfectly legal but are you sure that's what you want? – DarkKnight 5 mins ago Add a comment | Related questions 3691 How do I POST JSON data with cURL? 1672 How do I write JSON data to a file? 3244 How can I delete a file or folder in Python?
