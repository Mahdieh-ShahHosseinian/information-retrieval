See the inner exception for details Ask Question Asked today Modified today Viewed 5 times 0 I'm running into a serious issue with my .NET console application. The application parses JSONs and fills Model's properties with the parsed data. That part works. However, the other part, where it needs to insert it into the database - doesn't work. This is the error: An error occurred while saving the entity changes. See the inner exception for details.

 As far as I can tell, it's related to SaveChanges(), but I don't know what exactly. This is my current code (a small part of it): public static async Task UpdateDatabase() {
            Console.WriteLine("[INFO] Starting Database update...");

            using (var _context = new ReleasesDbContext()) {
                Console.WriteLine("[WAIT] Database update in progress... Please hold!");
                
                foreach (var release in AllReleases) {
                    _context.Releases.Add(release);
                    // Console.WriteLine($"{release.Id}) {release.ReleaseName} ({release.ReleaseId}) - {release.Stage}: {release.RunBy} ({release.StartedDate} - {release.CompletedDate}");
                    // _context.Add(release);
                }
                _context.SaveChanges();
                // await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
            }

            Console.WriteLine("[DONE] Successfully applied database update(s)!");
        }
 Those commented lines are there because I was experimenting with all sorts of different stuff... Also, this is my ReleasesDbContext.cs: using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace ReleaseGet {
    public class ReleasesDbContext : DbContext {
        public DbSet<Release>? Releases { get; set; }

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(@"my_connection_string");
        }
    }
}
 Also worth mentioning is that my model is pretty standard; I don't have anything special in it. Just about 20 properties, 2 of them are Int and the rest are String. Really hoping for someone to help me as I've been stuck on this issue for hours.
