   The relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of 120 university physicists was studied.. Although these two variables are highlycorrelated, some physicists produce many papers of little significance and other produce a few papers of great significance.. The responses of the community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication wereinvestigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in elicitingrecognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academicdepartments, and being widely known to one's colleagues.. The reward system operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive, to divert the energies of less creative physicists into other channels, and to produce a higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments than in the weaker departments..
