  The present paper is an attempt to formulate a positivetheory of motivation which will satisfy these theoreticaldemands and at the same time conform to the known facts,clinical and observational as well as experimental.  Itderives most directly, however, from clinical experience.This theory is, I think, in the functionalist tradition ofJames and Dewey, and is fused with the holism of Wertheimer,Goldstein, and Gestalt Psychology, and with the dynamicism ofFreud and Adler.  This fusion of synthesis may arbitrarily be called a 'general-dynamic' theory.
