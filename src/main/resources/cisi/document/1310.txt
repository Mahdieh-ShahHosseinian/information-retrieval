  We were introduced by Kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a seriesof qualitative changes, each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigmof thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science.Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis.  It seems, if we judgeby constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises andrevolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novelself-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature ofcumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least amongpsychologists.  This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one ofpsychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: JeanPiaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that heis hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades beendeveloping a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of thedevelopment of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhnacknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits asequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.
