    The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications ofthe National Library of Medicine, in conjunction with the NLM LibraryOperations staff, initiated in June 1970 a new experimental service calledAIM-TWX (Abridged Index Medicus-TWX) to provide rapid, responsivesearching of the medical literature.    This experiment is being conducted to identify the need for andusefulness of such services to help medical practitioners situated in isolatedareas, to assist in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education,and to provide information precisely when and where it is needed for healthcare.  A limited group of practitioners, students, and librarians is being givenaccess to the system so that it will not be overloaded and rejected because ofbusy signals, and so that a variety of user groups can test it.
