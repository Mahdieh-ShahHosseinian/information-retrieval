  My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer.  For seven yearsthis number has followed me around, has intruded in my most private data, andhas assaulted me from the pages of our most public journals.  This number assumes a variety of disguises, being sometimes a little larger and sometimes alittle smaller than usual, but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable.The persistence with which this number plagues me is far more thana random accident.  There is, to quote a famous senator, a design behind it,some pattern governing its appearances. Either there really is something unusual about the number or else I am suffering from delusions of persecution.
