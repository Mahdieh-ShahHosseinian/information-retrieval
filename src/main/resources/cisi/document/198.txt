  For many years administrators of library collections have soughtobjective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collectionsin the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearestapproach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledgeof the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  Thismethod consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations atthe conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field underconsideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of thefrequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted anda list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Grossand Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a libraryto purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.  Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twentyyears, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based havenever been examined.  These assumptions are:1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct   proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional   literature.2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are   representative of the entire field.3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted   equally.
