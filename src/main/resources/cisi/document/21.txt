  In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggressionin vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally differentfrom predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence ofterritory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixedup with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reductionof intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident infiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the packis virtually impossible and where co-operation without fightingis necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbiallypeaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and oftenfatal attacks on the weaker mate.  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how inthe human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, andnot guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, theaggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found inanimals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book bya master of his subject.
