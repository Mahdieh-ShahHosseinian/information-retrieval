Thus ageneral theory of epidemics can explain the growth of symbolic logic from 1847to 1962.  An epidemic model predicts the rise and fall of particular research areas within symbolic logic.  A Markov chain model of individual movement between research areas indicates that once an individual leaves an area he isnot expected to return.  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  epidemic model, epidemic process, theory of epidemics,growth of literature, history of symbolic logic, epidemiology of symbolic logic,epidemic curve, stochastic models, Markov chains.
