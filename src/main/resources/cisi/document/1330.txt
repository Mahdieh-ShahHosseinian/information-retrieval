  In the present study, Professors Lipset and Bendix cast doubton the validity of a number of widely accepted generalizationsrelating to social mobility: particularly (1) that there has beensubstantially less mobility in Europe than in the United States,(2) that social mobility tends to decline as industrial societiesmature, and (3) that opportunities for entrance into the businesselite become more restricted with mature industrialization.  Ina careful analysis of the existing literature, the authors marshalan imposing array of evidence in support of their major thesisthat social mobility is an integral and continuing aspect of theprocess of industrialization.
