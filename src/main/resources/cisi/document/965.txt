  An indexing or classification system should be judged by the retrieval results it produces, namely, the extent to which it bringsforth relevant material and rejects theirrelevant.  Thus, well-designed experiments should permit judging the relativemerits of different classification schemes. This notion, although self-evident, had remarkably little impact on the field oflibrary science prior to the 1950's.  During that decade, the first controlledexperiments on information retrieval were performed, and these mark a turningpoint in the history of classification research.  For the first time, experimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical importance to indexing and classification. It is my purpose here to review someaspects of the most notable of these experimental tests - the ASLIBCranfield Research Project.
