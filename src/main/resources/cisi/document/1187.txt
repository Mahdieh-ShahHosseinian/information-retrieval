    This book might be considered a conceptual inventory.  This is adeparture from the recent fashion of conducting "propositionalinventories," which assumes that important relationships have already beenexplored (Berelson and Steiner, 1964).  I assume merely that the conceptsrelevant to important relationships exist, and once having identified some,I hope to generate potentially significant propositions.  We lack thesystematic evidence that eventually must come, but there are illustrativestudies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time- norspace-bound.    I assume that there are differences among organizations, and hopeto account for some of them.  But I also assume that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between significant organizational differences andthe typical categories of business, government, medicine, and education.Likewise, I believe there is not a direct correlation between the academicdisciplines and useful categories of complex organizations.
