    This study of the UDC sets out from the assumption that both general andspecial documentation services can make use of a general classification.  On theother hand, it assumes that the criticisms of the UDC - the preference ofsome documentalists for alternative special schemes - imply that the UDCdoes not adequately provide the facilities currently needed.  In examining thesecriticisms and some special schemes an effort is made here to elucidate thosefeatures of the UDC which prevent it from being more widely used and then tosuggest how the UDC might be developed to provide the facilities needed.
