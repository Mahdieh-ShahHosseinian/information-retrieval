  Backed up by numerical data  derived from an ASLIB analysis of the plannedworld-wide system of UNISIST, the author critically investigates the claimeduniversity of the U.D.C.  According to it, the so-called "Universal DecimalClassification" proves to be fragmentary.  Terminological aspects are notprovided for, hierarchical order often is fictitious, and the representationof special fields is inadequate.  For the purpose of reforming the DecimalClassification, a reconstruction scheme is suggested, consisting of freefacets, with the aid of which special classifications can be compiled,according to the modular principle.
