  The word "system" as applied to information programs and activities is onewhich is very foggily defined.  The purpose of this paper is to help clarifythe concept and discuss it in the context of the librarian's conventionalplanning and administrative activities.  This is done through a narrationof the step-by-step procedures followed in the conceptualization anddesign of an actual library and information program.  The steps involvedare the following:  definition of the purpose of the program, and financialand administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged bymanagement; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumedaudience of the program; analysis and definition of program performancerequirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementingperformance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of programdesign; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design.Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need todefine what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing,and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costsin the design process.
