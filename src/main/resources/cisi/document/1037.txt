  Five assumptions commonly made by designers of management informationsystems are identified.  It is argued that these are not justified in many (if not most) cases and hence lead to major deficiencies in the resulting systems.These assumptions are: (1) the critical deficiency under which most managersoperate is the lack of relevant information, (2) the manager needs theinformation he wants, (3) if a manager has the information he needs his decisionmaking will improve, (4) better communication between managers improvesorganizational performance, and (5) a manager does not have to understandhow his information system works, only how to use it.  To overcome theseassumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a managementinformation system should be imbedded in a management control system.A procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is givenof the type of control system which it produces.
