  A concept is regarded as the common element ofboth classification systems and thesauri.  Realityand knowledge are not represented by words orterms but by the meanings "behind" these tokens.A concept of, say, an object, a property of anobject, a process, etc. is derived from verbal statements on these as subjects and may therefore bedefined as the whole of true and possible predicatesthat can be collected on a given subject.  It isfrom these predicates that the characteristics of thecorresponding concepts can be derived.  Commoncharacteristics in different concepts lead torelations between concepts, which relations in turn arefactors for the formation of concept systems.Different kinds of relationships as well as differentkinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointedout that an orderly supply of the elements for propositions (information statements) on new knowledgerequires the construction and availability of suchconcept systems.
