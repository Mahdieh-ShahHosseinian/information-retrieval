  Since 1966, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Research in ScientificCommunication has been conducting studies of the information flow process -the production, dissemination, and assimilation of information - associated withnine scientific and engineering disciplines.  This process in most disciplinesappears, from the dissemination point of view, to consume about five years -from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings arecited in a review.  To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this processand, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisonsof the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied,we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of themajor studies which were conducted for all disciplines.  We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order(1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some ofthe goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of thecommunication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it.
