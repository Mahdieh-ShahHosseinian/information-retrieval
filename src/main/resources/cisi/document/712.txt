  Abstracts can serve their purpose best only if they arecarefully written to transmit important information toreaders quickly and accurately.  This requires knowledgeof audience needs, habits, and desires; ability to identifythe key facts in the document; ability to organize thesefacts, to present them in the order best suited to theaudience; and ability to write the abstracts clearly,concisely, and in conformity with the style rules of themedium involved.  Some of these abilities are inborn, butall can be learned by study, practice, and criticism.
