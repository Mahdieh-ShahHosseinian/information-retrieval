  Using direct access computer files of bibliographicinformation, an attempt is made to overcome one of theproblems often associated with information retrieval,namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries,the greater part of which is used only infrequently.A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolicfrequency distribution of text characteristics onto arectangular distribution.  This is more suited to implementation on storage devices.  This method treats text as a string of charactersrather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsetsof strings such that their frequencies of occurrence aremore even than those of word types.  The members of thissubset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  Therectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a muchsimplified file organization and promises considerablecost advantages..K text searching, information theory, filed organization,direct access, information retrieval, character string, bit vector.C 3.42 3.70 3.73 3.74 5.6
