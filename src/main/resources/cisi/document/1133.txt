   The statement of the problem and the results of an experiment in automaticchoice of retrieval criterion are described.. The problem of criterion choice is interpreted in terms of a pattern recognition problem.. The criteria chosenas a result of learning are considered, as well as the retrieval noise and losses recorded in searches using these criteria.. The experiments suggest such "limit" noise level which is not liable to any substantial further reduction..The efficiency of choosing a criterion through learning is discussed.. Therelationship between information retrieval learning and nondeductive logic isinvestigated..
