   A new linear notation system which denotes carbon in terms of bounds and attached hydrogen(s) is used to correlate proton groups in organic moleculeswith chemical shifts.. The notation system is illustrated with acyclic andcyclic examples, and the production of tables of NMR data via computer by proton group vis-a-vis neighboring groups is demonstrated.. Tables of chemicalshifts in ascending order is a valuable by-product of the computerized system..
