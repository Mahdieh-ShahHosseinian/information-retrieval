  Anything that goes under the name of "production and distribution"sounds as if it clearly fell into the economist's domain.  An analysis of"knowledge," on the other hand, seems to be the philosopher's task,though some aspects of it are claimed by the sociologist.  But if onespeaks of the "communication of knowledge in the United States," thespecialist in education may feel that this is in his bailiwick; also themathematician or operations researcher specializing in communicationtheory and information systems may prick up his ears.  In fact, some ofthe knowledge to be discussed here is technological, and thus theengineer may properly be interested.  When I tried out the title of thisstudy on representatives of various disciplines, many were rather surprisedthat an economist would find himself qualified to undertake this kind ofresearch.
