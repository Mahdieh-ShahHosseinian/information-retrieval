  In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate thatI should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Disseminationof Information (SDI) operation and use.  In my opinion the technical feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the mainbarriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature.  At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, anSDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularlysince we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In additionto these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes(prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and,on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia.All these tapes are searched locally, involving the running of around fivehundred profiles weekly.
