   A good deal of work has been done over the years in an attempt to use statistical or probabilistic techniques as a basis of automatic indexing andcontent analysis..    Unfortunately, many of these methods are lacking in effectiveness, and themore refined procedures are computationally unattractive..   A new technique, known as discrimination value analysis, ranks the text words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documentsof a collection from each other; that is, the value of a term depends on howmuch the average separation between individual documents changes when the given term is assigned for content identification.. The best words are those whichachieve the greatest separation..    The discrimination value analysis is computationally simple, and it assigns a specific role in content analysis to single words, juxtaposed words and phrases, and word groups or thesaurus categories..  Experimental results are given showing the effectiveness of the technique..
