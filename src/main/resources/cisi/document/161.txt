  My terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies wereto bring Fishenden's work up to date.  This was published in the Journal of Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited numberof British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to thedevelopment of a national information service.  The present paper which coversthe literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  Itconsiders a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to developpolicies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Althoughan increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe andin the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the reviewconsiders mainly British and American investigations.
