    In the case of the present study, Dr.Lehnus was interested in applyinga method - in a non-standard way for that method - to a type of literature thathad not been addressed so far.  He proposed to begin with a single monographon the subject "cataloging," apply the method of citation analysis to thereferences of that work, and determine whether a core literature oncataloging could be discovered in this way.  There are innumerable examplesof core literatures in scientific fields obtained from journal articles orthrough the Science citation index, but research via the monograph in non-scientific subjects has been minimal.
