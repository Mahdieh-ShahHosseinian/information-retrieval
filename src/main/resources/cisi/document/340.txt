  This bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as itsstarting point - public, school, academic-research, and special libraries.This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently cleardistinction for the purposes of this work.  Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library'sdistrict and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes leviedfor library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries,and state library agencies are included in this category.  School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards ofschools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School librariesat the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level areincluded.  Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions ofhigher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which,while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely knownfor their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries,university libraries, and technical school libraries are included asacademic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.  Special libraries are those directed toward making information availableto people within a particular organization with fairly well-definedinformation needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries ofnonprofit organizations are common examples.  While distinctions between research and special libraries are notalways easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, noserious problems are created.
