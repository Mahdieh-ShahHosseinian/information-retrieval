  The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been aperiod of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Whereone or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrateeach kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre ofknowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtuallyevery major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts atthat time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth.This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally differentfrom that of the first.  But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and thatstudents in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledgeof its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systemsanalysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library'sprocessing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore representnot a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, toreflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correctthe errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the firstedition.
