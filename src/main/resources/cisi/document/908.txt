  This book was written in an attempt to fill a gap.  If one ignored the majorhistorical resources in other languages (which few United States students read),notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau andothers (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it wasplain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamentalneeds.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's AHistory of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains inits second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continuesas announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is verylimited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore,the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis ofcrosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly thedevelopment of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has beento tie it all together.  In the present offering, "the West" is used conventionally: European civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphereprogeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to "cover" even the West mayprove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet anunderstanding of those lands "beyond" would be most valuable to us all.Let us hope that someone will try to provide it.
