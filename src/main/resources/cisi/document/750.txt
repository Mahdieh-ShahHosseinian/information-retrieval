   Semiconductor physics literature is studied in order to investigate recenthypotheses relating obsolescence to the growth in periodical literature and thegrowth in the number of contributing scientists.. The results indicate thatobsolescence remains constant and that the two growth rates are, withinexperimental error, of equal magnitude for this subject over a five-year period.. These results are seen to be inconsistent with the assumption that anexponentially-growing literature possesses a constant utility..
