  The last ten years have witnessed rapid and often radical changes incomputer programming systems for social science data.  At least a dozendifferent program packages, collections, or systems (not to mentionhundreds of individual programs) have emerged by now and are in use bysocial scientists at universities and research centers all across thecountry.  It is probably safe to say that the bulk of these systemsand programs represent the individual efforts of a small group workingat one institution, often operating under a relatively restricted setof research and computing assumptions.  This parochial tendency has leftstudents and researchers with the often bewildering and always time-consuming problem of learning new procedures for processing their dataeach time they change institutions (or each time the institution changescomputers).
