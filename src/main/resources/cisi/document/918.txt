  The International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts,convened in Copenhagen in 1969 under the auspicesof the IFLA Committee on Uniform CataloguingRules (later Committee on Cataloguing), set inmotion the first major development in continuationof the success achieved by the Paris InternationalConference on Cataloguing Principles (1961) in thematter of the principles and general rules for entryand heading.  Taking under consideration the study of"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries"prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts ofthe Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, withJack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting aninternational standard bibliographic description formonographic publications.  There was commonagreement that the objective was the development ofspecifications for the necessary data elements, theirorder of presentation, and the punctuation to delimitthem.  These specifications should be designed tosatisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and,with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable,the needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It wasfurther agreed that these bibliographic descriptionswere to be made quite independently of the headingunder which they might appear in listings.  The workinggroup succeeded in its task and brought forth itsprovisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standardedition was published earlier this year.  The success ofthis standard is manifested by the continuing increasein the number of countries that have adopted it.
