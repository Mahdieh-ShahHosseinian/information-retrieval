  More and more examples accumulated of highly variable growthrates and of their influence on scientific careers.  Gradually the studybegan to incorporate calculations of the effects of variable growth ona wide range of scientific concerns: studying, teaching, research,publishing, citations, the basis of scientific prestige, promotions,unemployment.  It became apparent that generally unsuspected forces havea powerful influence on the careers of scientists and everyone elseenmeshed in rapid change.  This book presents some evidence for change and speculates aboutmany effects.  It also makes a beginning toward understanding theforces that cause and do not cause change.  It may provide some solacefor those in dormant fields who have wondered why life has passedthem by.  It may, perhaps, make a few highly successful scientists alittle more modest.  Most of all it may guide those who still have achoice - and so have we all.
