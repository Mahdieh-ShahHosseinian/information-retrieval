  This book develops a theory of formal languages from the point of view ofgenerative devices, mainly grammars.  Recognition devices, automata, areintroduced only as a secondary tool and are themselves presented within theframework of rewriting systems.  The main emphasis is on mathematical aspects of formal languages ratherthan application.  People interested only in applications to programminglanguages (resp. natural languages) would certainly prefer a morecomprehensive discussion on topics such as LR(k) grammars (resp. transformational grammars).  Such discussions lie outside the scope ofthis book.
