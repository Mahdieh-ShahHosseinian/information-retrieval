   A semi-empirical correlation, based on data from nine indexes, permits theprediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which will be used to index any given number of documents.. This is a function of thetotal number of index entries in the system.. A log-normal relationship, similar  to Zipf's Law, exists between total index entries and distribution ofterm usage.. Based upon the correlation, optimum vocabulary size and growth ratecan inferred, as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a storage medium.. The results agree well with published data and appear to be particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publicationoperations..
