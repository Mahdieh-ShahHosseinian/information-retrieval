This volume presents the results of a detailed study of theplace of foreign language materials in University research.In the course of our investigation, we accumulated a largeamount of data on the use of published information and oflibrary services by research workers and academic staff.  Ouranalyses have necessarily been limited by the specific aims ofthe project, but we have been constantly aware that there aremany other possible analyses of the same material.  For thisreason we have endeavoured to include in the Appendix as muchof this "raw" data as possible and to provide in the text itself,when presenting our own analyses, as much detail as possible ofthe methodology and other background information necessary forany full evaluation.
