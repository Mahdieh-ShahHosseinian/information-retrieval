   The most important objective factors are considered influencing the limitsand the depth of information needs of researchers and designers, i.e. the growth of information flow, the level of specialization, the qualificationstandard, the official position, the development rates of scientific ortechnical discipline in question the teamwork on scientific or engineeringprojects, the language barrier, the specifics of narrowly specializedterminology, as well as a number of subjective (psychological) factorslike inclination to creative work, type of memory, the time available, methodsof sources handling..   The investigations into, and account of, these factors are indispensable forraising the efficiency both of information systems performance and theactivities of scientific and engineering communities served..   Some statistical data are cited obtained during investigations intoinformation demand patterns for various personnel groups at research anddevelopment institutions..
