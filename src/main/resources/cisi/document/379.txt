  An alternative hypothesis tobe investigated is that, to a considerable extent, thereferences are scattered throughout all periodicalswith a frequency approximately related inverselyto the scope.  On this hypothesis, the aggregate ofperiodicals can be divided into classes according torelevance of scope to the subject concerned, but themore remote classes will, in the aggregate, produceas many references as the more related classes.  Thewhole range of periodicals thus acts as a family ofsuccessive generations of diminishing kinship, eachgeneration being greater in number than thepreceding, and each constituent of a generation producing inversely according to its degree ofremoteness.   The investigation covered, in the first place, thereferences quoted, in the course of four and two anda-half years respectively, by the current bibliographiesof Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are prepared in the library.  The source of eachreference being given, it was possible to arrange thesources in order of productivity, the results beingset down in columns A and B of the table, in theprevious column.
