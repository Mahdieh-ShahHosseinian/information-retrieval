  Successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic ofan inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable.By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical andconceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of orderwhich prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request ofan inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasingrequirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, becausethe searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to hisavailable search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree oforder attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on thebasis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by thesepostulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higherare its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to bemade on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.  The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experiencewith the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basisof this system and of its further development.
