  Information, whose handling is the topic of this book, isgenerated by change, and whatever is our unit of change is our unit ofinformation.  In a situation in which only three possible moves canbe made, only three fundamental units of information can be found,no matter how complex a structure we may build upon them.  Ourtopic is therefore a special sort of change, the change brought aboutin acquiring or keeping or transmitting elements of knowledge.
