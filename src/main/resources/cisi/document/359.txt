  More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet startedtheir lives' work, which at first was connected with the term"bibliography," but to which gradually the work "Documentation"was attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scopethan the establishment of a new technique dealing with printedand non-printed documents.  The great deal which inspired them, and those who workedside by side with them, was to render accessible the totality ofwhat is crystallized from human thought and to make of it acommon treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehensionand to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwillof all nations.  It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men,whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given tosee the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.  And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledgeand experience as scientist as well as librarian, not onlygave his strong and valuable support to the common work butadded to it fundamental and constructive new elements.  Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives farmore than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Sucha compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiouslyenough, up to now, there is no good general treatise ondocumentation available.  But his book gives us before all thingsan abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts.
