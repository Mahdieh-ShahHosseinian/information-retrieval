  Several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysisof the R and D project selection decision problem.  This research indicatesthat these models do not meet with important practical requirements.  Forexample, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additiveindex, in order to generate a wide range of project scores.  The additiveindex is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index.The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitraryfashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the modelbuilders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations onresulting project scores.  Comparative analyses relating project rankingsproduced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitabilityindex and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance ofthe scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the developmentof the model.  Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions ofproject data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals orcategories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implicationsfor final project scores and associated rankings.
