   Many synthesis, identification and control problems that arise in distributed parameter systems are studied.. Two major approaches, viz., the frequency domain approach and the time domain approach, are considered.. The techniques developed overcome many difficulties that are associated withoptimization problems in distributed parameter systems..   In the frequency domain, distributed systems described by the general(linear) telegrapher's equations are considered, over a finite band offrequencies.. An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed..Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulatedin terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles oflumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems..  Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are discussed..   In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method ofsolution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systemsare considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along the characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages.. It isshown that solving for Green's function (and associated eigenvalue problem) isnot required..   It is hoped that the methods developed here will lead efficiently to actualrealization of optimal distributed systems..
