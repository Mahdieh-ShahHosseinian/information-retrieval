  The expansion of government at all levels - international, national,provincial or state, and local - has resulted in increasing governmentinfluence on the life of each citizen.  Concomitant with this developmentis the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports,technical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that noone engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator,researcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person canfunction without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in fewareas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aidsbeen so little systemized.   The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well asthe trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a directdescendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of publishedmaterial has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of thetwo publications; Childs' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles.
