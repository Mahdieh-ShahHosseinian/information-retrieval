   One technique for searching a Co-ordinate Index is to compare each referencewith a Boolean expression of index terms.. This divides the file into retrievedand not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference scorecalculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages intheory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal tothe number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In thetest a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number ofreferences matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring techniquesuccessfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many relevant references as the Boolean searches..
