   Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasisto be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrievalsystems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is thepurpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the mostsignificant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection andrejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentencereference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automaticabstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functionsspecified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are ofsufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methodsof the automatic abstracting system is warranted..
