  The essay that follows is the first full published report on aproject originally conceived almost fifteen years ago.  At thattime I was a graduate student in theoretical physics alreadywithin sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvementwith an experimental college course treating physicalscience for the non-scientist provided my first exposure toout-of-date scientific theory and practice radically underminedsome of my basic conceptions about the nature of science andthe reasons for its special success.  Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partlyfrom scientific training itself and partly from a long-standingavocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow,whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility,those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical studydisplayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussionsof science, and their failures of verisimilitude thereforeseemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drasticshift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history ofscience and then, gradually, from relatively straightforwardhistorical problems back to the more philosophical concerns thathad initially led me to history.  Except for a few articles, thisessay is the first of my published works in which these earlyconcerns are dominant.  In some part it is an attempt to explainto myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn fromscience to its history in the first place.
