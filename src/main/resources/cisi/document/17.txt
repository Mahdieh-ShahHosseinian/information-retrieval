  There has long been a need for a continuing series to providescholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field oflibrarianship, a series which would select subjects with particularcurrent significance to the profession and provide an analysis ofthe advances made through research and practice.  Advances inLibrarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It willpresent critical articles and surveys based on the published literature,research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.   Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing frontsof librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of alllibrarians who can visualize its potential.Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series.As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological changehas an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has beenfound to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many expertsexpected.Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities ofautomation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hopeto get there."The Machine and Cataloging" reviews the current status of the machine-producedbook catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC.Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, asreported in "Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in thefuture, not the past.One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization ofcatalog information is that discussed in "Filing Systems for ComputerManipulation."This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggestspossible solutions.   For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequateknowledge of the facts.As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs oftraditional operations become essential.The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficultand reviews the significant advances of the past few years.   The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services muchmore rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, theinstructional media center.Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possiblemajor developments in library service in schools as well as for children inthe public library.Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and thatwhat remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.   Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.   Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerialplanning theory have for libraries.The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research inadministration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.   The article on library development in developing countries provides ananalysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting othercountries in providing the library service which is so important in the modernworld.
