   The breadth and depth of services that ninety-two medical school librariesoffer to individual user were ascertained by interviewing the heads of theselibraries, employing a standardized inventory procedure developed earlier(Bulletin 56:380-403, Oct.1968).. Selected aspects of the descriptive data obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth ofservices.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; theweighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librariansto reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall servicesrelative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a singlefigure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographicalregions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the surveydata for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the mostimportant of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - activities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - andrecommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate for the Medical Library Association..
