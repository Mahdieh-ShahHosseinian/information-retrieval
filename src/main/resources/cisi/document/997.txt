   The authors investigate the impact of a bibliographic retrieval/cardproduction system, such as the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), with specialattention to its role in cataloging.. Activities required at the local level tomake the LC card a functioning component of the catalog are described.. Thecharacteristics of the ensuring workload are examined, along with methods ofaccomplishing it.. These activities are seen as a factor in the persistence ofbacklogs.. The design of OCLC, because of the immobility of the terminal andthe absence of the catalog from the data base, by-passes this workload, leaving the local library to accomplish it by the method of its choice, as before, or to leave it undone..
