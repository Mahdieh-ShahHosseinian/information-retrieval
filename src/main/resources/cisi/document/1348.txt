  Documentation in the social sciences is varied in form and content,written for people in many walks of life, and fills several miles of shelvingin libraries that try to keep up with it.  Graduate students who qualify forpositions as professional librarians have to learn about this vastpreserve, and it is their need of guidance that explains the origin of thisbook.  The task of this book is to place in the reader's hands a sort of chartand compass to use in finding his way around and learning how the systemworks.  For each subject, the treatment falls into two parts.  First a specialist,sought out for his grasp of the literature, presents a bibliographicalreview of basic monographic works for a collection of substantive material.This review is followed by a list of reference works.  Informativeannotations are provided for all works except those adequately explainedby the title.  Specialized works are included, especially when they exemplifytypes of sources important for reference purposes.  First priority goes toworks which may be looked upon as basic for a program of service to ageneral clientele made up of scholars, students and the public at large.If some stress falls on bibliographies, it is because they serve as controlsfor opening doorways to even vaster information and to sources that aremore obscure.
