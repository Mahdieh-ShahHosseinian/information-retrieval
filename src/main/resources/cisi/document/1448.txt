  A distinctive feature of American weapons development andproduction is the use of private firms to carry forward most of theeffort.  This volume is primarily concerned with the government-business relationships within which these activities take place.Our title reflects our emphasis.  Weapons Acquisition is defined toinclude the conception, development, and production of technicallyadvanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Processemphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weaponsprograms, including the actions, reactions, and interactions ofgovernment agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicatesour concern with how these activities and relationships affect thequality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs.  The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge ofthese facets of weapons development and production.  Such anobjective classified the volume as a social science, rather thanadministrative study.  Yet most social science research, however "pure" the form, is ultimately directed at changing publicpolicy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with aspecific set of public policy recommendations.  Rather, it is largely limitedto providing understanding - a prerequisite to criticism, debate, revision,and improvement.
