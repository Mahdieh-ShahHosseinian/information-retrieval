  The paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the useof biomedical periodical literature carried out at the UK National Lending Library in February 1969.  The survey was designated to discover the subject,date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the mostfrequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of referencesto biomedical publications.  The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issuesinvolved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand wasless than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requestswere for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biologicalliterature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8per cent) involved English language periodicals.  Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literaturewere citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recentliterature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primarysources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the mostused indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents.
