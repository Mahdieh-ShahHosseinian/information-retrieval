  Before this study was begun in the spring of 1964, serious deliberationwas given to the question of American Council of Education sponsorship ofan evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities thatcomprise an important segment of the Council's membership.  There wasnever any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objectiveway what necessarily goes on continually in any event, though usuallyin a piecemeal and more impressionistic way.  Our Commission on Plansand Objectives for Higher Education, and other leading educators consulted,concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the Council'saegis was a suitable one.
