  The schedules of Edition 18, like those of 17, are based on theprinciple of subject integrity.  Both the subject matter and the notation arehierarchical, so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts.The schedules are developed according to logical principles, so that theclassifier is guided to make correct decisions.  The terminology of theclassification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literaturebeing classified.  For ease of use, this edition includes many more example notes, more detailedand precise instructions, and freer use of layman's terminology than did itsimmediate predecessor.  Since this edition is intended for use as a shelf-arrangement system forgeneral libraries of all sizes, its fulness is based upon the number of titlesthat large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields.  Sinceit is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies (forwhich the Dewey Decimal Classification is increasingly in demand in manycountries), it contains an increased number of provisions for number building.
