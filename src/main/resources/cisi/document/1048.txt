	There is probably no measurement task which publicservants face which is more difficult than that of measuringthe quality of service.  It is as difficult to measure thequality of hospital service, or of schools, or of socialwelfare programs, as it is to determine the quality of libraryservice.  It is equally as difficult to decide what actions totake in order to improve service.        Legislators, urban and regional planners, consultants,boards of trustees, accrediting teams, librarians, and ahost of other decision makers must act on the basis of someconclusions about the quality of service offered by librarysystems.  This handbook is intended for these groups, andespecially for practicing librarians.  The pervasiveness ofthe problem across all public service institutions, however,leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest toother groups.
