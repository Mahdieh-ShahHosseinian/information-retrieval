  Of the world's numerous kinds of libraries, the national and the universitymay properly be characterized as having responsibilities for both general anduniversal or nearly universal collecting in the realm of scholarship.  That is,these two, and only these two, commonly collect over a very broad spectrum,and in depth, material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge.  Herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it begranted, as it is here assumed, that almost no field of human endeavor canadvance without resort to the recorded past.  It is this twin aspect of theactivity of these scholarly libraries - collecting simultaneously in breadthand in depth - which produces most of their major problems.  The concern ofthis paper is with two of these problems which seem by far the most importantand difficult: the selection of materials and the utilization of subjectspecialists.
