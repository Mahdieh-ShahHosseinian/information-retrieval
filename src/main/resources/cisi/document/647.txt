   A procedure is developed for optimal allocation of resources among the manyprocesses of a library system.. Queueing theory is used to model processes aseither waiting or balking processes.. The optimal allocation of resources to these processes is defined as that which maximizes the expected value of thedecision-maker's utility function.. An application of the procedure to a specific library system is discussed..
