  We tried to concentrate on a few variables that might define thenature of a citation, and to keep the rest of the variables constant.  Inparticular, we used references in articles in a single journal, in a singlespecialty of a single branch of science, and in a narrow time period.Specifically, we investigated 30 articles dealing with theoretical highenergy physics, and published in Physical Review in the years 1968 to1972 (inclusive).
