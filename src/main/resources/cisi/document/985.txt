  The MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System)system at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has overthe past few years been one of the most significant and one of the mostpublicized automated bibliographic information retrieval systems.  Overtwo hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world,and in a variety of library journals.  The publicity that has attended thisproject has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented anexaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has onlymade the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part theexamination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments.  There has to date been verylittle careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report,and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of personsclosely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARSsystem.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overallvalue cannot help but be colored by this connection.
