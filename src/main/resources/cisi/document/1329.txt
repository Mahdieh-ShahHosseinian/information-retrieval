  The events of the past few years have led to a critical examinationof the function of science in society.  It used to be believed thatthe results of scientific investigation would lead to continuousprogressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War andthen the economic crisis have shown that science can be used aseasily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have beenraised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the onlymeans of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves,faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectivelyfor the first time, how the work they are doing is connected withthe social and economic developments which are occurring aroundthem.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; toinvestigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, areresponsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possiblesteps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to adestructive utilization of science.
