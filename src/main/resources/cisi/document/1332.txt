  In our attempts to extend the description and explanation oforganizational processes we have shifted from an earlier emphasis ontraditional concepts of individual psychology and interpersonalrelations to system constructs.  The interdependent behavior of manypeople in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a formor structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriatecollective level.  Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactorybecause of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of socialstructures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand,furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, oureffort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization ofan open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations.
