  The battle lines are being drawn for a great debateover the emotionally and politically charged issue of how libraryand information services are to be funded in the coming decades.Most librarians will be on the side of "conservatism" and "democracy,"favoring the continuation of traditional modes of tax-supported publiclibrary service with information freely available to allas a matter of right.  Information industry people, publishers,government officials, engineers, and even, perhaps, authors will beon the side of "progress" and "profits," advocating a new concept offor-profit or pay libraries, user charges, and information as a salable commodity.
