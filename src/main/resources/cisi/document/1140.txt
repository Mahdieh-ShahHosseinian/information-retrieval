   Two alternative concepts of isomorphism of classification are examined..It is shown that with the accuracy of up to isomorphism, the structure of aclassification is characterized by a certain semigroup.. For an important type of classifications, the algebraic structure of these semigroups is completelycharacterized by the relation of order on the set of generants.. The case of"perfect order" on the generants corresponds to hierarchical (tree) classifications.. The case of "incomparability" of the generants corresponds tofacet classifications.. All the other cases are "intermediate" between thesetwo types of classification..
