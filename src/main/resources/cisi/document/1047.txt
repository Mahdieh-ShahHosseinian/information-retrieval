    The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategyfor the Study of Attitudes.  This strategy is developed by devotingconsiderable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and,particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures ofsatisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set ofrequirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or twoelements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from anyprevious report in the area of job satisfaction.    Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for bothacademicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as apowerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the natureand correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area havebeen plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuringdevices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a differentscale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened thedoor for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of thejigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, thepresent volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developedmeasuring instrument that will allow comparability of results acrossstudies.  If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction.
