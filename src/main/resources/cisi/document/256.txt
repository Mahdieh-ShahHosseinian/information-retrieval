  We are concerned in this book with a number of classic themesof political science: with what the Greeks called civic virtue and itsconsequences for the effectiveness and stability of the democraticpolity; and with the kind of community life, social organization, andupbringing of children that fosters civic virtue.  In using surveyresearch to study these classic themes, we are also following thetraditional practice of relying on the most precise methods available tous for the investigation of these problems.  Perhaps Tocqueville andBryce, were they living today, would have relied somewhat onthe cross-section survey in their comparative studies of democraticattitudes.
