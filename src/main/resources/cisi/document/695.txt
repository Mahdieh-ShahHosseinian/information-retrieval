   An interactive search and retrieval system for Weswesser Line Notation (WLN)has been implemented.. The system employs bit screens, which are useful for filtering a file.. The user can graphically specify a search request structureand immediately receive graphic information as the result of the search.. FourFortran IV programs were developed to prepare bit screens for WLN files, input the search request to generate the WLN, iteratively search the WLN bit screen file, and generate a two-dimensional representation of the chemical structure directly from the WLN..
