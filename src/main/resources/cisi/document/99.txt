  An individual correlation is a correlationin which the statistical object or thingdescribed is indivisible.  The correlationbetween color and illiteracy forpersons in the United States, shown later inTable 1, is an individual correlation, becausethe kind of thing described is an indivisibleunit, a person.  In an individual correlationthe variables are descriptive properties ofindividuals, such as height, income, eyecolor, or race, and not descriptive statisticalconstants such as rates or means.  In an ecological correlation the statisticalobject is a group of persons.  The correlationbetween the percentage of the populationwhich is Negro and the percentage of thepopulation which is illiterate for the 48states, shown later as Figure 2, is an ecological correlation.  The thing describedis the population of a state, and not a singleindividual.  The variables are percentages,descriptive properties of groups, and notdescriptive properties of individuals.
