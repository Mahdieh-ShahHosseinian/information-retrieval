  On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems,Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  Weare both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledgeis acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products ofscientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate  data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of usturn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we drawmany of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that scienceprogresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process bywhich an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one;and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the oldertheory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment,or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a numberof classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, forexample, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observationwith scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts toproduce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientistsmay properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena andthat do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.
