  As part of a design study to specify a regional processingcenter for the New England state university libraries, it wasrequired to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect toeach of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries.  Participating states wereMaine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, andConnecticut.  This overlap data was needed to predict the degree ofjoint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency ofcollective reclassification.  The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections,showing, for example, that a random title from one library had a 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library.When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%.Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatestduplication elsewhere.
