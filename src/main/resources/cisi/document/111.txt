  The present study attempted to extend previous work onbibliographical reference patterns in sociological journalsin the following ways: (1) by selecting for study thosejournals to which American sociologists prefer to submittheir work, (2) by including, over a two-year period, allbibliographical references (journals, books, technicalreports, etc.), and (3) by including, for initial comparison,a journal from the physical sciences.  Such a study, it washoped, would yield data concerning similarities anddifferences among the sociological journals and betweenthe sociological journals and the physical science journal.
