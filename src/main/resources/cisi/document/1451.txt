    The line-formula chemical notation described in this manualis a precise and concise means of expressing the structuralformulas of chemical compounds.  Its basic idea is to useletter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbersto express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings.These symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end ofthe molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, eversince structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphicsymbols in this way.  This line-formula notation is simply anextension and standardization of this practice.
