  This paper is developed in two stages.  The firststage describes an experiment that explores propertiesof the class of words that are not useful in conveyingsubject meaning and distinguishes them from thoseclasses of words that do convey subject meaning tovarious degrees.  In particular, we study the clusteringproperties of these words; the analysis is based onstatistical properties alone, and techniques areintroduced that may be of value in other areas ofinformation science.  On the basis of the results of thisexperiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced anddiscussed.  Later papers by us and by Harter will applythis model to indexing.
