The following recommendations are made for the guidance ofauthors and editors, so that abstracts in primary documents may be bothhelpful to their readers and reproducible with little or no change insecondary publications and services..   Prepare an abstract for every formal item in journals and proceedings,and for each separately published report, pamphlet, thesis, monograph, and patent.. Place the abstract as early as possible in the document..Make the abstract as informative as the document will permit, so thatreaders may decide whether they need to read the entire document.. State thepurpose, methods results, and conclusions presented in the document, eitherin that order or with initial emphasis on findings..   Make each abstract self-contained but concise; retain the basic informationand tone of the original document..  Keep abstracts of most papers to fewer than 250 words, abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words(preferably on one page), and abstracts of short communications to fewerthan 100 words.. Write most abstracts in a single paragraph.. Normallyemploy complete, connected sentences; active verbs; ad the third person..Employ standard nomenclature, or define unfamiliar terms, abbreviations, andsymbols the first time they occur in the abstract..
