  Our survey, in other words, is offered within the bounds of descriptiveor deductive statistics which seeks to analyze a group, not attempt to estimatethe parameters of that population of which the group has been chosen as asample.  The latter role is assumed by inductive statistics which makes useof probability sampling. Accordingly, our data are presented in those formsand with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptivestatistics: arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories whichseem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequencyof requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested,the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries(university, pharmaceutical, etc.).  The tables are arranged to give evidenceof the types of frequency distribution revealed by the Survey, as well as toindicate central tendency, dispersion, rank order, and possibly correlationsfor significant factors.
