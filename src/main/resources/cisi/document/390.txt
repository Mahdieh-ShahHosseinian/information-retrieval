  The test results are presented for a number of different index languagesusing various devices which affect recall or precision.  Within the environmentof this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained withthe group of eight index languages which used single terms.  The group offifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance,while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus ofEngineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Ofthe single term index languages, the only method of improving performancewas to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of termsdepressed performance.  The use of precision devices such as links gave noadvantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination.
