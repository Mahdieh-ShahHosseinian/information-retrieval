A computer program has been written and used whichsimulates the several-year operation of an informationsystem and computes estimates of the expectedoperating costs as well as the amount of equipmentand personnel required during that time period.  Theprogram has been used for the analysis of severallarge systems and has proven itself to be a usefulresearch tool for the study of systems with so manycomponents and interrelated operations that anequivalent manual analysis would be extremelycumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps evenimpractical. This paper describes this program andshows, as an example, some of the results of a simulationof two of several suggested designs for a specificinformation system.
