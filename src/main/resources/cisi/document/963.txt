  It is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited forthe testing of theoretical hypotheses. Librarians and their assistants respect research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in helping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in most instances) of the usefulness of such research for theimprovement of their own organizations.Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision anddiscipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices; therefore, significant results can often be obtainedwith smaller samples and in shorter periodsof observation.  People working in libraries do not feel they should curtaildisclosures about basic processes.  Elsewhere professional employees are obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitorsor to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislativecommittees.  At least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or more libraries almost always lie close at hand - there could hardly be any more convenient institution.
