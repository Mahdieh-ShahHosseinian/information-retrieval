  DIALOG is the name given to an interactive, computer-based informationretrieval language developed at the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.  The DIALOG systems consists of a series of computer programs which have beendesigned to make full use of direct access memory devices (in which data located anywhere on the device can be accessed in approximately the same amountof time) and video display units to provide the user a rapid and powerful meansof identifying records within a file which satisfy the particular informationneed.  By providing the user full display access to the indexing vocabulary,and the ability to modify search expressions, DIALOG becomes a data processingextension of the human operator who directs and controls the process accordingto his own personal needs.
