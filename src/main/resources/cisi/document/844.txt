  Between 1969 and 1971 Bath University Library experimented with a personalizedinformation service to social science researchers at the Universities of Bathand Bristol.  The principal service offered was a manual current awareness service, based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals.The service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for eachreference notified, and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. Therelevance performance was good, and few references had been seen before; someprecision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall.  The wholeservice was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high priority among the various possible claims on university resources.  Thosewho had the closest contact with the information officers had the bestscores on most aspects evaluated and rated the service most highly.  Somegeneral observations on the place and value of an information service in auniversity library are given in conclusion.
