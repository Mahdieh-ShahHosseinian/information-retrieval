  In 1971 the Committee on Chemical Information of theNational Academy of Sciences, National Research Council,recognized the problem of large data bases and accordinglycreated a subcommittee to investigate the problem and itsimpact on chemical information.  The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee wasto survey organizations that generate and/or process largedata bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways inwhich one can view a data base as being large.  It can belarge in terms of having a large number of entries orrecords (or bibliographic references).  It can be large inthe sense of having a large number of fields or dataelements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can bethought of as large in the sense of having a large numberof searchable or selectable elements, and it also can belarge in the most readily understandable sense of havinga large number of characters in storage.
