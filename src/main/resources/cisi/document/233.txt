  It is the purpose of this paper to analyse a class of distributionfunctions that appears in a wide range of empirical data - particularlydata describing sociological, biological and economic phenomena.  Itsappearance is so frequent, and the phenomena in which it appears so diverse,that one is led to the conjecture that if these phenomena have any propertyin common it can only be a similarity in the structure of the underlying probability mechanisms.  The empirical distributions to which we shall referspecifically are: (A) distributions of words in prose samples by theirfrequency of occurrence, (B) distributions of scientists by number of paperspublished, (C) distributions of cities by population, (D) distributions ofincomes by size, and (E) distributions of biological generally by number ofspecies.
