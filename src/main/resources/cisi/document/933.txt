  A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has alwaysbeen that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trainsfor current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately,the picture many faculty members have of what today'srequirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates are thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we faileven to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past andtrain people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of publiclibraries.   Library education, like the publiclibrary itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate ofoblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a positionof relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will witheraway, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is noshortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and forgraduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both.An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called "Dust Gatherson the Public Library" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline andloss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter isdead - while the public library lives on).
