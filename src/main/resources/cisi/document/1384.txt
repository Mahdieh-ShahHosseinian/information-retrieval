  The purpose of this book is to present an introduction to a body ofmathematics concerned with the abstract notion of "structure."  Itspreparation has been motivated by the belief that knowledge of themathematics of abstract structures will be of value to investigatorsinterested in various kinds of empirical structures.  The mathematicswith which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs,or more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurationscalled digraphs, which consist of "points" and "directed lines."  Whenthese terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematicalmodels of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflectstructural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematicalterms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory hasapplicability to many different fields of investigation.
