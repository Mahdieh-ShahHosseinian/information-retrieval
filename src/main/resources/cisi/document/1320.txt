  This book is addressed to scientists and engineers, to administratorsof research and development, and to all others who are concerned about theeffects of organizations upon the work of their members.  This book isone of the first major studies to examine the relationship between a scientist's performance and the organization of his laboratory.  Unlike manyprevious expositions about the best environment for technical people, thefindings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a widerange of research personnel.  Work progressed over the next four years, and a number of intriguingresults began to emerge.  But as these were discussed with otherinvestigators studying different kinds of R & D laboratories, discrepanciesappeared.  It became clear that a broader study was needed before onecould be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for researchpersonnel.  We set out to design a study in which standardized instrumentswould be administered to scientists and engineers in several types oflaboratories.
