  During the past year we have been one of the organizationsparticipating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the useof routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For sometime we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject CitationAlert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for ScientificInformation as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  Thesethree sources differ in their scope and methods, but share thesame ultimate objective of providing a computer-based currentawareness service.  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides onlyauthors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds withbiological systems, but provides abstracts which are available forcomputer search.  The computer can also search for molecularformulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of allcompounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original formwas based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list ofreferences to older work, and the output is then a list of new papersciting this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', whichis a search for words in the titles of current papers and is thereforeanalogous to a CT search.  This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained sofar with these three services, and the potential use of systems ofthis type.
