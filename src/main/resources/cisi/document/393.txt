  The publication of this collection of essays opens a new era forlibraries, taking the first departure in 2,300 years from that durablemodel conceived by the librarians of Alexandria and endlessly replicatedby every succeeding generation of librarians, right down to the presentday.  The Alexandrian model persists through the unexamined faiththat to be good a library must be vast and always growing.  The paperspresented here examine that faith scientifically, demonstrate that itrests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition, and consign it tothe limbo of outworn dogmas.
