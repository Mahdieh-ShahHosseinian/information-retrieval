   A system for computer-based thesaurus production and maintenance has been developed at Columbia University School of Library Service.. The system ishighly flexible, providing for all the types of data elements which have been used in both thesauri and subject heading lists, with additional features foundto be useful as a result of the ongoing research program at Columbia.. Threethesauri in widely varying subject fields are in the final stages of productionunder the system.. As a result of the simultaneous development of the thesauri (based on actual indexing universes) and of the production system, which is part of a larger program of research in information handling problems, a varietyof new techniques and procedures have been developed as their usefulness became evident..
