  If the (major) premise is accepted, that fullyeffective machine-strategization of a retrieval systemdepends upon the use of a (hierarchically) structural(but highly flexible) notation as the equivalent forthe verbal access provided by either unitermic orarticulated conceptual indicators, a faceted classificationlogically emerges as the desideratum.  The two aspects of a structural notation mostdeterminative here are hierarchicality and uniformuse of general categories (the latter, not merelyfor the sake of uniformity as such, but as the meansto a heightened flexibility).  These desiderata couldof course be present on the "idea plane" alone; butwithout their being present notationally they do notfurnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the typeof assistance it requires for optimal functioning.  The second (minor) premise ought to be that theUniversal Decimal Classification, being bothhierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desiredstructurality.  But the melancholy fact is that thisdesideratum is not always satisfied, for instancewhen UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy whendivision by general category would be equally appropriate.
