   Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexingsystems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selectedfor fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval..Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined whichinclude those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes..   The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that manycompound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components,and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Othercompound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..   These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy fromearlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture aterm, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have beenemployed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA)for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and haveenabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..   It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on theapplication of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinatebasis..
