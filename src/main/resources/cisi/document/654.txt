   Networks and network models of industrial and military systems have received much attention in operation research literature.. The extension of networkmodeling to library networks provides some interesting twists of the usual models.. A general library network is offered, a mathematical statement of the network problem is given, and the solution of the problem is discussed.. Anexample of the use of the model in evaluation and design situations is provided.. The necessity for further work in both theoretical and applied areasis cited in the summary..
