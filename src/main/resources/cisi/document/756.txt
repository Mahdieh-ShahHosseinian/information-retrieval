  In a 1973 paper, Sengupta analysed references to biochemical journals in anattempt to provide a guide for librarians with a limited budget.  He not onlyranked journals by the absolute number of citations made to 1969 volumes, butrelated the number of citations to the number of papers and even to the numberof words in each journal, as perhaps 'a better guide to selection of journals for subscription than position in the ranking list.'  (A similar procedure is adopted in two more recent articles by Sengupta on physiology and microbiologyjournals.)
