    This book deals with on-line systems for bibliographic search andretrieval.  The literature on this subject is increasing rapidly and new systemsare appearing all the time.  We have attempted to provide a broad survey ofthe characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of present systems.  Ouremphasis is on the design, evaluation, and use of on-line retrieval systems,primarily from the viewpoint of the planner and manager of informationservices.  It is oriented toward the "intellectual" aspects of informationretrieval rather than the hardware or programming aspects.  We hope thatthis book may have some value for all students of library and informationscience.
