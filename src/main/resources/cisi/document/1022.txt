  Reverberations of the publishing explosion of recent years are reaching usnow.  Production of monographs and journals, research reports and governmentdocuments has been increasing exponentially to the point that Britishuniversity librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of spacewhich their American counterparts have been struggling with for a numberof years (judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in Americanlibrary journals).  The force of this sense of constriction has been somewhatmitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of fundsavailable for book purchasing, and by the increasing price of books.  However,when space in the library does become filled, obviously something mustbe done to create more space, because the flow of material is certainly notgoing to cease.
