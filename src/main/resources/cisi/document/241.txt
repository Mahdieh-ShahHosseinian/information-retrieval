  This guide is a recapitulation and refinement of the substantivecontent of a one-and-a-half day course which was given beforethree groups of Federal scientists and engineers during the Fall of1967.  Its purpose was to train and informworking scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficientmeans of seeking and acquiring work-related information.  The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growingneed for working scientists and engineers to share and participatein the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms,and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newerapproaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination. A further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate thefullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which arelikely to have a greater and greater effect on his professionalactivities.
