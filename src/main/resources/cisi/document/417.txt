    The present study is concerned with the performance of intelligent adultsin our own culture.  The tasks discussed are short (half-hour), moderatelydifficult problems of a symbolic nature.  The three main tasks we use - chess,symbolic logic, and algebra-like puzzles (called cryptarithmetic puzzles) -typify this class of problems.  The study is concerned with the integratedactivities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concernedwith perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables.The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little withlearning, and not at all with development or differences related to age.Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes thedetails of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is,half a second or less).  Similarly, long-term integrated activities extendingover periods of days or years receive no attention.
