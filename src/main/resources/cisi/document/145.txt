     The data in that survey covered the year 1971.  Many recipientsof the 1972 document have requested updated information.  Accordingly,the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey.The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responsescame in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all memberorganizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sentto individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI.     Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilationthe reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date sourcefor information as to which centers are processing which data bases.     Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDICand/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data baseprocessing organizations.  The use of online search services wasrelatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not berepresentative of the 1976 online situation.
