   We have investigated the relative merits of searching on titles, subject headings, abstracts, free-language terms, and combinations of these elements..The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of thedata elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well..Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, wasfound to be relatively unimportant..
