  The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangementhas become increasingly apparent as more and more bookcatalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Manyof the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rulesfor Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to copewith when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not anobject, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming arepractically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedurescan make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog,or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, andthese modifications are made in this proposed code for computerfiling of complex alphabetic entries.
