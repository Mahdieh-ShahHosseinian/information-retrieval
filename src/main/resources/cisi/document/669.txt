  The Wiswesser chemical line-notation is an uniqueand unambiguous method of representing chemicalstructures by a linear series of letters, numbers,ampersands, and hyphens.  These symbols are meaningful tochemists familiar with the notation and can be processedby automatic data processing (ADP) equipment.   The uniqueness of the line-notation permits the useof alphanumerically arranged lists of notations fordictionary-type searches.  This ordered arrangementpermits the rapid location of a specific compound or aspecific class of ring compounds other than benzenoid.
