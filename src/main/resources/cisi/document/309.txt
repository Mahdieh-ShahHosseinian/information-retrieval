   A fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the IBM 7094 is described.. The system is characterized by the fact that several hundreddifferent  methods are available to analyze  documents and search requests..This feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the exact sequence ofoperations initially unspecified, and adapting the search strategy to the needsof individual users..   The system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment, butalso to test the effectiveness of the various available processing methods..Results obtained so far seem to indicate that some combination of analysis procedures can in general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information..A typical search request is used as an example in the present  report toillustrate systems operations  and evaluation procedures..
