This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of usein 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom.Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern ofinformation use.  Information transfer in libraries isrestricted to the use of documents.  It takes noaccount of documents used outside the library, stillless of information transferred orally from personto person.  The library acts as a channel in only aproportion of the situations in which information istransferred.Taking technical information transfer as a whole,there is no doubt that this proportion is not themajor one.  There are users of technical information -particularly in technology rather than science -who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on deskcollections of handbooks, current periodicals and personalcontact with their colleagues and with people in otherorganizations.  Even regular library users also receiveinformation in other ways.
