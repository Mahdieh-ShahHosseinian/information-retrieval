  A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate andrecord knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay tosatellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recordedknowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for thispurpose.  The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress isconstantly being elevated as more and more information is presented.Without information and its necessary control, a society is not onlystagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlledby archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future itis destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.  Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archivescontained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nationsgrew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of acountry's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives andlibraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information tosucceeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In thisway, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and passthis memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutionscontain the written and graphic record of social memory and humanheritage and provide society with information on which to base actions,develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.
