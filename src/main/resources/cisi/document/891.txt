   The Price Gilbert Memorial Library of the Georgia Institute of Technology has reproduced its entire card catalog on microfiche, and is updating this basic file with a bimonthly cumulated supplement produced by the Computer OutputMicrofiche (COM) process.. The total catalog has been placed, with in appropriate microfiche reader, in every academic and research department oncampus - thereby taking the chief bibliographic record of the library to the faculty user.. Remote bibliographic access is complemented by a telephone request and delivery service which provides delivery of requested books orphotocopies from the library to the faculty member..
