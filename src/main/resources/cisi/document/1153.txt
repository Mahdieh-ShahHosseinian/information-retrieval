  In this book I have presented the tests according to the researchdesign for which each is suited.  In discussing each test, I have attemptedto indicate its "function," i.e., to indicate the sort of data to which itis applicable, to convey some notion of the rationale of proof underlyingthe test, to explain its computation, to give examples of its applicationin behavioral scientific research, and to compare the test to its parametricequivalent, if any, and to any nonparametric tests of similar functions.
