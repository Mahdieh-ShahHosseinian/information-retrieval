  This paper describes and specifies the rules for generating a code to represent chemical formulas.  It may be used either as a notation or for internal manipulation by computer for registration, screening, and atom-by-atom search.  It is basically a connection table in a concise format which alsocontains abnormality information relating to specific atoms or relations between atoms.  The notation produced by these rules unambiguously definesa structure (as a connection table), but the notation is unique only to agiven numbering (or citation order) of the atoms.  Hence, its uniqueness isdependent on the numbering uniqueness of the atoms in the structural formula.Techniques for the use of the code in registry and substructure search arealso discussed.
