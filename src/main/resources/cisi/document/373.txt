  Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have verylittle verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specificrequirements for information.  Such information is needed to properlydesign or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statementsof requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinionrather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have beenobtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there areextremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine andstate user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests anapproach or point of view that might help this situation by providing amethod of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a moreconvenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes severalexamples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data thatsupport these statements.  In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirementsof workers in the field of science and technology, with no seriousattempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quitelikely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could beextended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.
