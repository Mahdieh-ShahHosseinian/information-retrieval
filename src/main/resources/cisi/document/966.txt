  Libraries and information services of the twenty-first century almost certainly will be the beneficiary, or perhaps the victim, of enormous technological change. High-speed search by computers, microrecording techniques, remote interrogation consoles, and great communication networkswill someday place the world's knowledge at our fingertips.
