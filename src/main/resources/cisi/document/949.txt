  A wise German librarian has linked the library administratorand the cataloger as working for the common aim of economyin work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library'sresources.  This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of cooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards.It is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectivessetting limitations in such a way that more values will not bedestroyed than are created.  This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled "Tasks for thefuture."  There was a time, and not so very far back, when thelibrary administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.  Inthe more immediate past, however, the two have become separated,so that their closer collaboration does need to be set downas a task for the future, the immediate future at that.Many new problems of administration have served to busy theadministrator, and most catalogers have had more work thanenough, with the result that administrators have come to knowless and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to knowless and less about general library administration.  The situationnow is that the administrator will be forced to pay moreattention to cataloging because it has become a major problemfield.
