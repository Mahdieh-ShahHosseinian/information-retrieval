  The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced onlyat our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories aboutsociety.  Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in thehistory of American radical movements, is in some quarters growingwider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in theNew Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at leasttemporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.  This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In somepart it is due to the fact that these social movements are still newand their political activism consumes their necessarily limitedenergies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need timeto produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory isscarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the factthat American radicals are often more American than they know andmay prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to theintangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoreticalproblems is probably due to the close links that some young radicalshave with the "hippie" contingent of their generation, whose moreexpressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culturedispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile "hassles" ofintellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, ashas been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal toreason.
