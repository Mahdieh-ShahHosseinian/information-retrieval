  When it was decided that Cognitive Psychology would not specifysize limits for articles, and that we would publish relevant papers inartificial intelligence, we hardly anticipated devoting an entire issue to asingle piece of work.  However, Winograd's "Program for UnderstandingNatural Language" seems sufficiently general and important in itsimplications to warrant the experiment.  Some readers will find sufficientthe first two sections, which present, respectively, an overview of thesystem and what it does, and a first-rate evaluation of research in artificialintelligence on natural language processing, semantics, and theorem proving.Others will want to explore in detail the structure of the syntacticcomponent, the treatment of semantics, and the programming languagefor specifying theories of problem solving.  Each of these contributionsis significant in its own right.  Together they form a unique, integratedsystem capable of parsing, interpreting, and acting upon the informationcontained in complex natural language discourse.
