The Ad Hoc Discussion Group on Serials Data Bases was formed as aresult of an informal meeting held during the American Library Association'sConference in Las Vegas on June 26, 1973.  Those in attendance wereprimarily interested in the generation and maintenance of machine-readableunion files of serials.  (This author's involvement in that meeting andthe later activities of the group stems from a contract between theNational Library of Canada and York University concerning an investigationof the problems associated with machine-readable serials files.)
