  The book is designed to serve multiple purposes.  First the needs ofpracticing librarians, particularly those who are just beginning theircareers, and require a general guide and source of operational andbibliographic information, have been given special consideration.  Asecond purpose is to provide a textbook for library school and otheradvanced students whose interests are oriented toward the literature ofthe life and physical sciences.  The book could also help persons inmanagement positions of organizations in which the establishment of alibrary is contemplated, presenting, if only from a review of the contents,the scope of such a department.  Finally it should be a good resource forlibrary consultants engaged in assisting management to make the rightdecisions.  The requirements of all of these audiences have been assessedand endeavor made to meet their somewhat varied requirements.
