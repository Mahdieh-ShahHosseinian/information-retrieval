  Since 1958 the Chemical Abstracts Service has beenworking toward establishing a computer-based system forhandling chemical information.  Briefly, the concept ofthe CAS system consists of sets of special subject filesin the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2)chemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4)applications.  With the importance of compounds incorrelation studies, and the need to interrelate compoundsand the huge collections of chemical and other data, ahighly developed subsystem, called the Registry System,for handling compounds must be the first step in theactual operation of an over-all computer-based service.The Registry System will include files of compounds interconnected with files of associated data that permitidentifying the compounds and retrieving them from thefiles.
