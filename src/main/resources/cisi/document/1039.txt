  In this study, five major criteria (realism, flexibility, capability, caseof use, and cost) for evaluating the suitability of management science modelsfor R & D project selection are established, through personal interviews withR&D administrators and management scientists.  A suitability rating system,based on these criteria, is used by the author to rate twenty-six managementscience models for their suitability of use in R&D project selection decisionmaking.  Profitability index and scoring types of models were found to havegenerally higher ease of use and lower cost performances than the other types.The linear and nonlinear models had generally higher flexibility, while thelinear, nonlinear and zero-one models had generally higher realism than theother model types.
