  The continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research ofothers, coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of publishedmaterial during the past several decades, has placed new emphasis onthe old arts of assembling, coding, and disseminating recordedknowledge.  In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself inresearch on improvement of traditional library systems.  In otherinstances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections andtheir intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still othersystems have progressed from the passive role of responding torequests to the active role of supplying documents, or references tothem, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of amore descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to inthis book as "document transfer systems," implying that the productbeing retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than theinformation (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrievalsystems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern.The document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing,an abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape.
