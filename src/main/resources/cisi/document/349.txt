  These lectures do not present a descriptive theory of actual behavior.Neither do they present a positive theory of behavior for a superintelligent,fictitious being; nowhere in our analysis shall we refer to the behavior of an"idealized, rational, and economic man," a man who always acts in a perfectlyconsistent manner as if somehow there were embedded in his nature a coherentset of evaluation patterns that cover any and all eventualities.  Rather, theapproach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem ofchoice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that isconsistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences.  He mustconsciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculatetheir implications for action.  Such an approach is designed to help us reasonand act a bit more systematically - when we choose to do so!
