   Library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which theyhave had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author-title-subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be ableto look it up easily in present-day card catalogs.. However, they mayremember a surprising amount of such "nonstandard" information as thecolor of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could thistype of "nonstandard" information be profitably exploited in computerizedcatalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely beused, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today'slibrary patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantialminority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results ofa memory experiment to test the memorability of various types ofnonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking accordingto relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of variousnonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the averagepatron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrievalstrategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredthas many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is greatenough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in manysituations..
