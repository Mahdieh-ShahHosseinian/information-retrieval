  This paper is not an official policy statementof the American Library Association norof the Office for Library Education.  It issimply an exploration, an outline of possibilitiesfor consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is to generate discussion that will leadeventually to a statement of Association policythat the profession will support and makeeffective.  A basic assumption on which the statementrests is this: that the library occupation ismuch broader than that segment of it which isthe library profession, but that the professionalsegment has responsibility for the definitionand supervision of the training and educationrequired by the complete range of activitiesencompassed by the occupation.  Librariansare not the only persons who work inlibraries, but librarians are the ones who areconcerned with the advancement and improvementof the library profession.  It follows thenthat it is the obligation of the professionalsto engage actively in the establishment andmaintenance of standards and norms governingthe preparation of people who work atany level in libraries.  They should define andguide the kinds of preparation most useful atthe pre-professional level and notmerely the education of those who will holdpositions at the level we now call "professional."
