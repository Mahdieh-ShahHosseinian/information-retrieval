  My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understandingof what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limitedmyself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed "libraryhousekeeping" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing,periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is tomake a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, anddisseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processeswhich can be automated here and now to improve the quality ofservice which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that thedescriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librariansin developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries.
