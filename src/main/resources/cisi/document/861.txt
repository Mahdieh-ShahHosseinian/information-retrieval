   Viable on-line search systems require reasonable capabilities toautomatically detect (and hopefully correct) variations between requestformat and stored format.. An important requirement is the solution of theproblem of matching proper names, not only because both input specificationsand storage specifications are subject ot error, but also because various transliteration schemes exist and can provide variant proper name forms in the same data base.. This paper reviews several proper name matching schemesand provides an updated version of these schemes which tests out nicely onthe proper name equivalence classes of a suburban telephone book..  Anappendix lists the corpus of names used for algorithm test.
