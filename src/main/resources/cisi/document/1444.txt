    The work reported here is a study of the utilization of the cardcatalog of a very large library, specifically the principal catalog ofthe library system of Yale University.    The study was motivated by two basic concerns, one of them of along-term, or exploratory, nature, the other of a short-term, oroperationally supportive, nature.  The long-term concern is the questionof how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library thatcan be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-termconcern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing cardcatalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to userrequirements.  It was recognized that a carefully designed study of actualutilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light inboth areas of concern.
