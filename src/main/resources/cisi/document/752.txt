  It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presentedwhich appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverserelationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly notnew; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA andABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not-Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising fromCranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked.In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that thesimple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test resultscoming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II madefurther modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forwardto read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence ofsubsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expecteddecreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the resultsof a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, hasfour qualifications to the basic statement.
