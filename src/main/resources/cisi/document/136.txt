  The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology is now in itsthird year.  Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe andevaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the fieldduring the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standardsand our means of professional communication.  The field of information science and technology continues to evolve andgrow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas ofinterest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coveragechanges.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and InformationCenters, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering automation of technical processes and the other covering documentnetworks, and a new chapter has been added on information systemapplications in education.  Such applications are important not just becausethey involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities butbecause they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be ofvalue to anyone interested in the total communication process.   At the same time, "core" chapters of the review are continued:  informationneeds and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organizationand search; publication and distribution techniques; automated languageprocessing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation;and professional aspects of information science.These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and theirannual literature is significant, large, and growing.
