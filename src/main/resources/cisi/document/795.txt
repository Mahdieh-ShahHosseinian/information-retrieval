   The paper describes some properties of simple interconversion devices whichenable material initially subject indexed by a particular indexing system to bemade available to other institutions using different indexing languages in such a form as to be readily integrated into their indexes.. Reference is made to theoutline Intermediate Lexicon which is the germinal form of a switching languagefor the field of information science.. Difficulties and problems in effecting satisfactory information transfer through such an interconversion scheme areexplored, and suggestions made for the lines upon which further research needsto be undertaken.. The author was the Classification Research Group representative on the international working party concerned with the Intermediate Lexicon..
