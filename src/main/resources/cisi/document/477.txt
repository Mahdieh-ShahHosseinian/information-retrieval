    "The machine language [information language in our terminology D.S.]should not be confused with the machine code: (Upenskii, 59:357).  InRanganathan's more general terms: There should be no confusion between theidea plane and the notational plane.  Many difficulties in classificationarise from this confusion.  This paper is devoted mainly to problems onthe idea plane.    "The IR-language I want to talk about, is the language in which theinformation to be retrieved is formulated, i.e. a declarative sentencelanguage, not the imperative sentence language of the programmer-retriever"(Bohnert in Samet, 62.1:10), that is, the information language should notbe confused with the programming language.  (To avoid misunderstandingsit would perhaps be better to say "descriptive" instead of "declarative"and to state explicitly that in a descriptive sentence an imperative maybe described which is, however, not to be executed by the system but tobe retrieved by appropriate searches.)
