  Pegram lecturers are supposed to talk about science andits place in society.  The ordinary way of doing this wouldbe either to talk popular science or to adopt one of the variousstyles in humanistic discussion of the reactions between menand science.  Previous lecturers in this series have givenaccounts of the content of space science and made excursionsinto the philosophy and the history of science.  Althoughprofessionally my concern is with the history of science, I havea certain prehistoric past as a physicist, and this has ledme to treat these lectures in what is, perhaps, an extraordinaryway.  My goal is not discussion of the content of science or evena humanistic analysis of its relations.  Rather, I want to clarifythese more usual approaches by treating separately all thescientific analyses that may be made of science.  Why shouldwe not turn the tools of science on science itself?  Why notmeasure and generalize, make hypotheses, and deriveconclusions?
