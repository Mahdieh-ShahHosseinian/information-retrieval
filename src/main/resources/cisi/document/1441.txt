  This study represents the result of some fifteen years of contact withthe Universal Decimal Classification, as a user, as a reviser and as aclassification teacher.  As a Information Officer at the Atomic EnergyResearch Establishment, Harwell, I was concerned with the use of theUniversal Decimal Classification (UDC), both as classifier and as userof the resulting catalogues; I was also directly concerned as LiaisonOfficer for the Atomic Energy Research committee for UDC with thedevelopment of the Code of Practice which later became the basis of theSpecial subject edition for nuclear science and engineering.  Withaccelerators; this work was carried out along the general lines indicatedin this study, and is now part of UDC, which indicates that modern ideascan be accommodated within the scheme without undue strain.
