A cluster analysis procedure is described in which 188 journals in thediscipline of physics, chemistry and molecular biology are grouped into clusters.. Most of the clusters are easily identified as subdisciplinarysubject areas.. The data source was the cross citing amongst the journalsderived from the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived in turn fromthe Science Citation Index (SCI).. The JCI consists of journal by journaltabulation of citings to and from each journal processed in the SCI..Two-step citation maps linking the clusters are presented for each discipline.. Within the disciplines the clusters of journals form fullytransitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..
