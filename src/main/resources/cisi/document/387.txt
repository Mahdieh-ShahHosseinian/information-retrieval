    The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in theprocess of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching andadministration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at WesternReserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which hasbeen elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed.    My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributesto the total communication system in society and the meaning of that rolefor the library profession, and having determined the requirements of thatrole to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professionaleducation.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of thecommunication system within the individual as related to his physiological,neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning andreading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to anexposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society,together with the place of the library in it.
