   The analytical problems of developing quantitative techniques for R & D investment management are often complicated by the existence of conflicting goals.. Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seekthe highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and thegreatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict themanager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. This  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to projectselection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-productfactory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solvethese project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination problems..  Most approaches in the literature have treated these three problemsseparately..
