    The present paper is offered as the first of a series of articles in whichPRECIS will be reviewed as a potential multi-lingual system, having in mindthe obvious need, notably in a European context, for standard and language-independent methods of subject analysis and document description.  Thisfirst paper outlines the origins of PRECIS, and considers its use in English-Language indexing.  A second paper will deal in general terms with thesyntactical model which is used for producing PRECIS input strings andindex entries.  Later papers will then review the application of this modelto indexing in, firstly, the Germanic languages (e.g. German and Danish),and, secondly, the Romance languages, illustrated by French.
