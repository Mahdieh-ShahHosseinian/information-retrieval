  In 1955 the Publications Committee of the Library Associationapproached my chief, Mr. A.J. Wells, with a request that he shouldwrite a book on subject cataloguing.  At the time, Mr. Wells waspreoccupied with the inauguration of the British National BibliographyCard Service, and he made the suggestion, which was agreed by theCommittee, that I should undertake the task.  The result is scarcely anadequate substitute for the book which Mr. Wells would have written.Nevertheless, he has had a major part in shaping my views on subjectcataloguing, and in this sense the present book stems back to him,though he might not subscribe to all the views now put forward.
