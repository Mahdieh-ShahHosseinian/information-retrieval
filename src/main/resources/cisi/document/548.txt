  University printing presses exist, and are subsidized by the Government forthe purpose of producing books which no one can read; and they are true to theirhigh calling.  Books are the sources of material for lectures.  They should bekept from the young; for to read books and remember what you read, wellenough to reproduce it, is called 'cramming', and this is destructive of all true education.  The best way to protect the young from books, is, first, to make them in such a way that no one can find them without several years' training.  A lecturer is a sound scholar, who is chosen to teach on the groundthat he was once able to learn.  Eloquence is not permissible in a lecture; itis a privilege reserved by stature for the Public Orator.
