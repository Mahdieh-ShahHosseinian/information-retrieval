   The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrievallanguage for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnicaldocument collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes generaland special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive tohigher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and alexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of thedictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords..   The indexing procedure includes:  analysis of document content and itscharacterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of thesearch pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are describedwhich are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects thatconstitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body ofthe document..   Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination usingmathematical-statistic methods are given..   Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses thereare the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a singleabstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in futurecharged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptorlanguage.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practicalsensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be   based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods fordocument and request indexing..
