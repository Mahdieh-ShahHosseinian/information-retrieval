  The Medical Library Association has long been aware of the need for athird edition of the Handbook.  Changes in library practices, proliferatingdemands upon established libraries, and the development of new onescreated the need of an up-to-date tool.  Like the earlier editions,this Handbook is such a tool, a manual, not a survey of the state of theart.  It offers practical advice to all - fledgling librarians startingtheir careers, experienced librarians transferring to the field ofhealth sciences, established medical librarians refreshing memories oradopting procedures unfamiliar to them, and specialists in related fields.
