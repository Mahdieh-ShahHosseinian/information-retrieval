  The purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at militaryproblems which we and others with whom we have been associated havefound fruitful in insights and productive of solutions.  Essentially weregard all military problems as, in one of their aspects, economicproblems in the efficient allocation and use of resources.  We believethat this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconcilingthe apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who areresponsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primaryinterest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of themilitary budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable.
