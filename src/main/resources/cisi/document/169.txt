  The genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call Ireceived during the fall of 1966 from Dr. James G. Miller, thenDirector of the University of Michigan's Mental Health Instituteand currently Vice President for Academic Affairs of ClevelandState University.  He asked what I am sure he thought was arelatively straightforward and easily answered question:  Whatare the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials?On closer inquiry I discovered that Dr. Miller was exploringthe possibility of using computer technology to develop a national,multi-media information network, that would electronically integrateour colleges and universities, eventually providing each of thema comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works andeducational services.  He subsequently sought to breathe life intothis idea of promoting the formation of an organization called theInteruniversity Communications Council (EDUCOM).
