  This book is one of the products of a contract initiated by the AutomationTask Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by theU.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development Corporation.  The project included a questionnaire survey of all Federallibraries (2104), as of December, 1970, to gather systems planning data and to identify Federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems.Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Surveyquestionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems.From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensivereview of the automation literature, information was distilled for use inthis Handbook.
