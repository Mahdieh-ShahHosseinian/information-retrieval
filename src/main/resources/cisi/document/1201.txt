  Our purpose in writing this book has been to give a systematic account ofmajor topics in pattern recognition, a field concerned with machine recognitionof meaningful regularities in noisy or complex environments.  The most prominent domain-independent theory is classification theory, thesubject of Part I of this book.  Based on statistical decision theory, itprovides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once theyhave been represented abstractly as vectors.  Attempts to find domain-independent procedures for constructing thesevector representations have not yielded generally useful results.  Instead,every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to itsspecial characteristics.  Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domainhas received by far the most attention.  Furthermore, work in this area hasprogressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description.Part II of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topicsin visual scene analysis.
