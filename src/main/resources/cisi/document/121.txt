  This chapter is directed to those whose vocation (or avocation)is information.  While we may call ourselves librarians, informationscientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists,IS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have onething in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in thedissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interestedin far more than the techniques for transmission of information fromone point to another.  Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that "themedium is the message," we must concern ourselves with not only themeans of document dissemination, but also the content and value ofthe documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughoutmost of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator shouldthink of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data,evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controllingtheir transmission to a target: the reader.
