  Computer programs developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) produceuncontracted though otherwise canonical Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) for a  fairly broad class of compounds.  An associated front end allows a chemist tocommunicate with the programs by drawing structures on a Rand Tablet.  TheWLN generation programs accept connection table input, either from a previouslyexisting file or generated from the Rand Tablet drawing.  The programs recognizesituations which they cannot handle - the output is thus either correct WLNor a message by which the programs acknowledge their limitations.  In general,correct WLN will be produced for any compound containing not more than onenonbenzene ring.  Work is under way to extend this to polycyclic fused ring systems.  The philosophy and concepts behind these programs are explained alongwith the more interesting algorithmic results.  The role of the WLN-generationprograms in a developing NIH chemical information system is briefly discussed.The WLN programs are written in Fortran IV and have been developed on a PDP-10 computer.
