  The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System is a computer-based system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis ofcomposition and structure.  Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-aloneinput, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organicchemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increasedto include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has beenintegrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system,Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves majorchanges in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniquesfor registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for eachsubstance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclaturederivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The generaldesign of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclicsegments, is presented.
