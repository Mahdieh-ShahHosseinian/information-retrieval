  In the last two decades, dramatic increases in thescope and volume of scientific research have occurred, asmay be illustrated by the fact that the amount of scientificliterature is doubling approximately every ten years (Price1963).  For the scientist who needs to locate particular itemsof scientific information and for the documentation specialistwho must make them readily available, the organization andmanagement of this huge and expanding store of informationis a serious problem.  Increasingly radical solutions are beingproposed.  For example, some experts would like to scrapscientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal.Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developedto enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively.
