   This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factorin retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its "breadth" asit is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, whichfunction most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or thosewhich are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experimentand uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the "optimal" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a fewdocuments are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are moreeffective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documentsare wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. Acorollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the sameaverage breadth where one indexing consists ofsemantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and theother consists of merely "reasonable" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..
