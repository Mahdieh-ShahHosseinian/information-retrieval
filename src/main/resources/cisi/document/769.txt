  Recent work at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has beenconcerned with the development of automatic classification procedures forinformation retrieval.  This has taken the form of research into methods ofclassification of keywords extracted from documents, with a view to usingthe classes found for co-ordinate indexing of technical material.  We cannotclaim to have solved this problem because the methods we have been able to develop so far cannot be applied on a sufficiently large scale.  We have,however, made enough progress to make us feel that this a fruitful line ofresearch.
