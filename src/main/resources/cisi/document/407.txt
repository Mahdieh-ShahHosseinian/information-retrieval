  The first part, written by myself, deals with 'Comparativelibrarianship and comparative method' and is intended for bothteachers of comparative librarianship and their students.  It can beapproached in a number of ways:  The first three chapters outlinecomparative librarianship and the theoretical basis of itsmethodology against the wider background of other comparative sciencesand the scientific method.  The three chapters following are purelypractical and explain the various steps of writing a comparativestudy.  The last chapter is intended for teachers.  The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographicalguide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world.It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianshipstudents in the course of their project work, on replies to aquestionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world,and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over anumber of years.
