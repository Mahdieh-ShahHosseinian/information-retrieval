  As far as philosophers are concerned, the Conference seems to be justifiedprecisely because of the present state of the Classification of Knowledge.  Fortwo thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a majorphilosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophicalpreoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equallyignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technicalmodels of classification and highly developed classifications of variousbranches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory generalclassification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophicalproblems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification isimportant from the theoretical as well as practical point of view becausethe general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories ofknowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialistsin classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.
