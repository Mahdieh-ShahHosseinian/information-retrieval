    This book originally set out to be a kind of reporting-in-depth ofthe American Library Association Pre-Conference on Acquisitionsheld in Atlantic City in the summer of 1969 - a report embracing notonly the essential content of the formal speeches, but also the floordiscussions and after-hours bull sessions.    Meanwhile, however, a closely similar treatment of the problem ofhow to buy library materials, long in process, suddenly shaped up andwas published by ALA in November 1969.  This was Purchasing LibraryMaterials in Public and School Libraries by Evelyn Hensel and Peter D.Veilette.    A treatment of the acquisition process in college and universitylibraries was also taking shape at this time and became the January1970 issue of Library Trends.  The acquisition problems of researchlibraries were likewise getting detailed examination in the two annualInternational Seminars on Approval and Gathering Plans in Large andMedium Size Academic Libraries, sponsored by Western Michigan Universityin the fall of 1968 and the fall of 1969.
