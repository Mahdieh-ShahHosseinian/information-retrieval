  Each year thousands of books are published by thegeneral, the technical, the governmental and the universitypresses in this and other countries.  From this overwhelmingmass of new publications every library must, within the limitof its funds, select that small part which will be most beneficial to the community it serves.  This is properly anawesome responsibility to the young inexperienced librarian.  Tothe competent veteran it is a task which though carried onweek after week never can approach the ease of a wellmastered routine.  Each book examined requires the exerciseof careful judgement, integrity, emotional control at times,and scrupulous honesty, guided always by a sense of purpose.
