   Evidence provided by the Dainton Report indicates that special libraries inthe UK are far from fully exploiting the photocopying services provided by thenational libraries.. As these photocopying services are legally obliged to operate at cost, they offer significant economies to any special library which exploits them systematically..   This paper describes a simple graphical method of estimating the savings that can be made, or the extended subject coverage that can be obtained at noadditional cost, by substituting photocopies for relevant papers in the peripheral periodicals relating to any well-defined scientific or technicalsubject..   Though photocopying charges must be realistic, the confident exploitation of the national photocopying services depends on the avoidance of arbitrary jumps inphotocopying charges..
