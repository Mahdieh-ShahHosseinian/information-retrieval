    Therefore the purpose of this book remains the same as that of Textbook onMechanized Information Retrieval - to teach basics to those who have had noprevious exposure either to the field or to computers, or both.  Therefore,the action is slowed to the point where the logical principles of informationretrieval systems are laid bare.  Other books have been published that emphasizecomputer programming - this one does not.
