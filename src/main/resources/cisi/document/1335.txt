  My book Exit, voice and loyalty: Responses to decline in firms,organizations, and states was published in l970.  Reactions to itand applications of its concepts have been fairly numerous and Ihave myself had quite a few afterthoughts.  It will therefore bedifficult to bring these matters together in a passably structuredpaper.  In the following, I shall limit myself to four broadareas of inquiry which have been so arranged that my own furtherreflections figure rather prominently though by no means exclusivelyin the first two sections while the latter two are more heavilyweighted with reports and comments on the research and contributions of others.
