  The amount of scientific and technical information published annually in the form of journal articles, conference papers, reports, theses,patents, and books now greatly exceeds, in every field of interest, theamount which may be scanned by a scientist wishing to keep himself completelyup to date in his own subject.  For a scientist wishing to inform himself ofnew developments in neighbouring subject-fields the problem iseven greater.  Consequently, either the scientist reconciles himself to theknowledge that he is not aware of all relevant information in his field orhe places increasingly more reliance on such bibliographic tools as areavailable to guide him towards the relevant literature.  First among such tools is the abstracts journal.
