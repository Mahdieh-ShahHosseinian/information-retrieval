  In this paper we report a first experiment using a new computer-basedtechnique to identify clusters of highly interactive documents in science.  Wecontend that these clusters represent the scientific specialties which currentlyexhibit high levels of activity.  This technique, we believe, opens the wayto a systematic exploration of the entire specialty structure of science,including both the internal structure of specialities and their relationshipto one another.
