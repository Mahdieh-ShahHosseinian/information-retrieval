   The paper treats the probability distribution in information flow systems, and presents the analysis of a statistical distribution model called the "hyperbolic ladder" and of the consequences following from this model which were revealed in linguistics (Zipf), theory of scientific information (Bradford), and in science of science (Lotka), etc.. The identity of themathematical essence of various distributions, investigated by many authors ontheir own objects of study, is shown..   The link is considered between the basic probability distribution and someproblems studied in the modern mathematical theory of information.. Examples are presented of the use of distribution regularities in various systemsanalysis..
