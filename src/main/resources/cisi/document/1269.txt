  This book had its origin in a set of five public lectures givenat the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University duringOctober and November 1959 under the auspices of the Yale Departmentof History.  The subject (whatever its name) had just come througha stage in its growing up during which it almost seemed asthough every would-be practitioner of the art deemed itnecessary to exhibit the completeness of his dedication bywriting the history of the whole of science through all itsperiods.  Hoping that this historiographic phase hadevaporated, and feeling incompetent in too many scientificand historical directions, I resolved instead to essay theexperiment of speaking only from those areas in which I hadreasonable firsthand experience at research.
