  Simultaneously with its development of a computer-based Chemical CompoundRegistry System, Chemical Abstracts Service is devising procedures for automatically converting systematic names of organic compounds into atom-bound connection tables which can be manipulated by computer.  A study ofsystematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionaryof word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting names to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexesshow that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature,but also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been writtenwhich are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and thepreparation of computer programs is now under way.
