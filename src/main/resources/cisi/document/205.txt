   The conventionally erected and reported circulation analysis of serial usein the individual and the feeder library is found to be statistically invalidand misleading, since it measures neither the intellectual use of the serial'scontents nor the physical handlings or serial units, and is nonrepresentativeof the in-depth library use of serials.. It fails utterly to report or even tosuggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources.. Theactual mechanics of the serial use analysis, and the active variables in thelibrary situation which affect serial use, are demonstrated in a simulatedanalysis and are explained at length.. A positive design is offered for theobjective gathering and reporting of data on the local intellectual use andphysical handling of serials and the relating of resources.. Data gathering inthe feeder library, and implications for the extension of the feeder library'sresources, are discussed..
