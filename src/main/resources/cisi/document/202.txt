   Users of information in science and technology have been studied in greatdetail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading andsearching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probingfor this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..   Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow,the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfactionproduced by present information services and does not yield insight into theextent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon theresponse of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs,since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs..   Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information systemmust, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience ofbiomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation whichcan explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors..Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individualssuch as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect toenvironment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medicalpractitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of theircolleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medicalschools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..   It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in amethodology which will permit the determination and prediction of theinformation needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..
