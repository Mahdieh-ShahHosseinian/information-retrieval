  No code of cataloging could be adopted in all points by every one,because the libraries for study and the libraries for reading have differentobjects, and those which combine the two do so in differentproportions.  Again, the preparation of a catalog must vary as it isto be manuscript or printed, and, if the latter, as it is to be merely anindex to the library, giving in the shortest possible compass clues bywhich the public can find books, or is to attempt to furnish moreinformation on various points, or finally is to be made with a certain regardto what may be called style.  Without pretending to exactness, we maydivide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-titleor bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the BostonMercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the BostonPublic (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, thecatalog now making by the Library of Congress.  To avoid the constantrepetition of such phrases as "the full catalog of a large library" and"a concise finding-list," I shall use the three words Short, Medium, andFull as proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short familyare not all the same size, that there is more than one Medium, and thatFull may be Fuller and Fullest.  Short, if single-columned, is generallya title-a-liner; if printed in double columns, it allows the title occasionally to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium doesnot limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds four lines, andgets many titles into a single line.  Full usually fills three or fourlines and often takes six or seven for a title.
