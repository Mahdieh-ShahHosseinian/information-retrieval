  The sustained interest in documentation, as a key to the retrieval ofinformation in the literature of the sciences, has obscured largely thepotential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzinginformation needs.  In the belief that a discussion of the latter may beof value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists, a review ofinvestigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here.  Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretationof statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in avariety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements.Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collectedand explained in several fields of science for these main purposes: todemonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universalresearch use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many localsituations the general use of books and journals.
