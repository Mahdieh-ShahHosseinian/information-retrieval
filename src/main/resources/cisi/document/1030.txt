  The ideas presented in this book developed during the course of ourparticipation in a comparative research project, the International Studiesof Values in Politics, which was a study of the relationship betweencharacteristics of local political leadership and the behavior of localgovernments in India, Poland, the United States, and Yugoslavia.  Among the first problems we confronted were those of measurement.In the fall of 1965 the first pretest of value-scale items was under way.The goal of the pretest was to develop valid and reliable scales of valuesin four national samples.  The second problem we had to face arose from the nees to obtain "comparable"measures of community "activeness" in four countries.
