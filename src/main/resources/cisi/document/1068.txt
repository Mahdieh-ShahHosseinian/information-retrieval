  This book was started during the years 1935-1936 and wasintended to be a systematic psychology of the older type.  Myeffort was to synthesize the holistic, the dynamic and the culturalemphases which, each one, excited so many young psychologistsof the time.  I felt that they were intrinsically related to eachother, and that they were subaspects of a single, larger, encompassingwhole.  I felt also that they would make more meaningful myprevious studies at the University of Wisconsin in comparativeand experimental psychology, and in biology and neurophysiology.Furthermore, I felt that they would enable me to serve bettermy humanistic aims.
