    Although the use of games in professional education hasbecome widespread only during the last decade, the method hasbeen used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used inmilitary training when the "real thing" was either unavailableor too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games havebecome more and more sophisticated, and many now use largeelectronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game wasintroduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide varietyof disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education,from primary school classes to courses for experienced professionalmen and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion"has been the rapid development of sophisticated managementtechniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, whichhave been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.
