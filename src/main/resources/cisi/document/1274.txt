  The small college has stood staunch in its desire tosupply the liberal education and perhaps it has donewell in maintaining this position.  On the other hand,many of the large universities have shifted theemphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study.Still others have tried to develop both side by side.Few of the small colleges have kept astride with theinevitable consequences of such a situation.  Thefew who have are sending an increasing number oftheir graduates to these universities to complete theirtraining.  As an example of this, it is the boast ofPomona College that over seventy per cent of hergraduates have taken subsequent professional training.It has become the evident duty, therefore, of thesmall college to prepare its men, not only to entersuch graduate schools, but also to meet successfullythe ever-increasing intensity of competition foundthere.  This in addition to supplying a broadcultural education.  This duty has brought with ita number of problems of first magnitude.  One of thebiggest of these is the problem of adequate libraryfacilities.  It is the purpose of this paper to discuss thisproblem with special reference to the student whosecollege major is chemistry.
