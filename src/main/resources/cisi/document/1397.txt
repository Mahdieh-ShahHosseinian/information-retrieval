  The subject of switching and finite automata theory needs no introduction.It has become a part of every computer science and electricalengineering curriculum, and rightly so.  It provides techniques usefulin a wide variety of applications and helps develop a way of thinking thatleads to understanding of the structure, behavior, and limitations andcapabilities of logical machines.  In this book I have tried to cover thewhole subject, starting with introductory material and leading to themore advanced topics, assuming a minimal technical background on thepart of the reader.  I did not attempt to provide detailed techniquesfor the design of specific circuits, but rather to formulate methods and todevelop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems.For once such general principles are understood, the relevance of specificprocedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter ofengineering decisions.
