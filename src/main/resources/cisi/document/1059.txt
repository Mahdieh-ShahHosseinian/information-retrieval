  Why do libraries use microforms?  According to a 1974 survey by amicropublisher, saving space was the reason given by most respondents.Holmes, on the other hand, found, "to acquire materials not otherwiseavailable," as the major reason.  Others include: (1) Instead of bindingserials (journals are retained unbound for two to three years afterpublication, the period of heaviest use, and are then discarded andreplaced by microform versions; (2) To preserve deteriorating materials;(3) Easing access to bulky materials such as newspapers; (4) To provideworking copies of materials too delicate for continued use such as rarebooks; (5) to save money - in most cases the cost of an out-of-print set orserial backfile will be substantially less in microform than the cost of afull-size reprint or the cost of the original on the used book market;(6) Ease of acquisition - i.e., acquiring materials which would otherwisebe difficult to acquire; (7) Mutilations reduced.
