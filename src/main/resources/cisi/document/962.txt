   Concern with the questions of when and how best to computerize the catalog ofa large research library, and how to improve an existing conventional catalog, motivated a study of the utilization of the main catalog of the Yale University Library.. The study was carefully designed to provide a representative sample ofcatalog use.. Traffic through the catalog area was observed over a period of morethan a year.. A schedule of interviews with catalog users was based on observed traffic volume by hour of day, day of week, and time of year.. More than 1,000 interviews were completed, using nonleading interviewing technique.. Informationwas derived on the catalog user's objective, starting clues, and universityaffiliation.. Search success was determined.. Follow-up studies were performed on the catalog cards and the actual books identified in successful searches.. Reasons for search failure were determined for know-item searches.. Availabilityand accuracy of different categories of search clues were ascertained.. Publishedalgorithms for searching computerized bibliographic files were evaluated.. Attention is given to the feasibility of automatic construction of computerized catalogs.. Some of the available results are presented and discussed..
