  Pattern recognition has been introduced to thechemical literature as a general tool which can be usedby the chemist to reduce masses of experimental data torelevant information.  Perhaps more importantly, itprovides connections between raw, multivariant dataand sought-for information without making restrictiveassumptions about the underlying statistics of the data.The general problem has been stated as follows.  Givena collection of objects and a list of measurements madeon each object, is it possible to find and/or predict aproperty of the objects that is not directly measurablebut is known to be related to the measurements viasome unknown relationship?  The only assumptionmade is that similarities and dissimilarities amongobjects are reflected in at least some of themeasurements.
