   The paper reviews the highlights of a four-week trial period (November 19 -December 18, 1970) during which the Medical Library of the University ofVirginia experimented with a new remote-access bibliographical control andretrieval system via its TWX machine.. The system, called AIM-TWX, wassponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communicationsand utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California..Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, includingthose currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrievedeither on- or off-line..   Various aspects of this service are described, including problems ofstaffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSHvocabulary which is the principle "language" of the man-computer dialog..   The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were runon any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whosetraining schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment washighly successful in terms of searches and citations..   At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors,and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interestamong the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a largenumber of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginiaparticipated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demandfor this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide withgreat rapidity..
