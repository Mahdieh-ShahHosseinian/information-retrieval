  The work published here is rather like those conclusive statementsof renaissance science that located the soul not in the human frame butin the human spirit.  The author of this work may face the wrath of themedievalists among our fellow professional catalogers.  At the least, thepublication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of ourcataloging methods, because the difference between title unit entry andauthor-equivalent unit entry, a confabulation of main and unit entryarising from tradition rather than practicality, can be clearly seen not only in the job classifications and job descriptions of catalogingdepartments, but also in our philosophy of librarianship.
