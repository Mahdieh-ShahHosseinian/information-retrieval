  The patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all othersfrom making, using or selling his invention.  In furtherance of aconstitutionally recognized goal - "To promote the Progress ofScience and the useful Arts" - Congress has thus adopted a constitutionally authorized means - "securing...to Inventorsthe exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries."
