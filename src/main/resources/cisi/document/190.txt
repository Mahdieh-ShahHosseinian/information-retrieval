   MEDLINE (MEDLARS-ON-LINE) is the new on-line, interactive bibliographicsearching system which was recently developed by the National Library of Medicine.. The system provides users with lists of bibliographical citationsand other information from a three-year file of over 1,250 biomedicaljournals.. A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University ofVirginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 andMarch 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through theprinted indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINEsearches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Askedwhether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user chargeson July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressedsome reservation and doubts.. The survey gives reason to believe that with theimposition of user charges the use of MEDLINE will decline..
