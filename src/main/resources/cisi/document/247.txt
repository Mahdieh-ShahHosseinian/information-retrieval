  The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Onlynow and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding ofthe implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly described.  It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry anddescription, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, orother similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on suchworks, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few ofwhat seem to be the most important aspects of each.  Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States.Many interesting practices have always been part of catalogingabroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken severalbooks.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seemsnecessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If areader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful,that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging.I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in thiscountry will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  Inno sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism.
