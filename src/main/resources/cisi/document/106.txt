   In a rapidly advancing scientific discipline, new contributions will supersede older ones.. This selection in favor of recent literature should beobservable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, byage of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also dependson the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, ifcertain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fitto age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than thosein the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree ofselectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful incomparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines..
