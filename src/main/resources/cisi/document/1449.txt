    This book is based upon two recent research projects in weeding andidentifying core collections.  However, it became apparent that the principlesand techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library collections.    This work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes:    1. As a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion, knowledge, andserious research in the field of weeding.  The author's own research is reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  Inaddition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study.    2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out theirpresent collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain andjustify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for "weedingwithout tears."    3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal withthe acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one of the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful collections.    4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped thatlibraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costsof weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount ofcirculation and in user satisfaction.
