    The alphabetical subject catalog, either self-contained, or as the subjectelement in the dictionary catalog, is a later development that the systematic,or classed, catalog (Realkatalog, catalogue raisonne).  In this country ithas almost completely displaced the latter.  The principal classed catalogs   now remaining are those of the Engineering Societies Library in New York,the John Crerar Library in Chicago, and the Science and Technology Departmentof the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  There are, nevertheless, many thingsto commend the classed catalog.  Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument betweenthe classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs bothand explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabeticalcatalog is concerned.  However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, forone not completely the master of the system of classification, there is noapproach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is notin fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library'scollections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced.
