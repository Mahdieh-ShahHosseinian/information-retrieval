  If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple butfrequently neglected principle that college library service goesbeyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation andstorage.  The college library exists, not merely to house andcirculate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teachingprocess with reference service, to afford faculty members libraryopportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage studentsto read more and better books.  Administration is essentially aservice activity, a tool through which library functions are morefully and efficiently realized.  The present work retains most of the material of the first edition,but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book wasplanned not only as a text in the teaching of college libraryadministration but also for independent professional reading.  Becausereaders have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies usefulfor reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and insome cases extended.
