  The structure diagrams of chemical compounds are widelyused in the communication of chemistry.  They are also usedin chemical information systems, mainly as keys for theretrieval of associated information.  However some chemicalinformation systems hold property data as well as structurediagrams in machine-readable forms.  If structure-propertyrelationships could be investigated easily within chemicalinformation systems, then the usefulness of the systems wouldbe considerably increased.  Described below are some resultswhich have been obtained during investigation of structure-property relationships using a combination of regression analysis and some techniques of chemical structure handling usedin information systems.
