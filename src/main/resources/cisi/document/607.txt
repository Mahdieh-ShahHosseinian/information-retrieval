  This is a period for rapid growth in information systemsfor the sciences and professions.  Information centersare springing up across the country.  Federal agenciesand private groups are both collaborating and competingto establish comprehensive systems.  Changing the library's name to "information center" ismore than linguistic faddism.  New, active roles subordinatethe library's traditional, passive role as a preserverand codifier of knowledge.  "Information center"bears analogy to "economic center" and "transportationcenter."  Like these centers, its significance is intransaction.  The significance of a transportation centerlies in routes to other centers.  The significance of aninformation center lies in communication lines to knowledge producers and knowledge users.  Information centers arejudged by their information "throughput," not by their "holdings."
