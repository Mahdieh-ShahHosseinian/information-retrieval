  This book is primarily a research monograph, in which the discussionof the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to theirsurrounding context in information retrieval as a whole; it is not atextbook, and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choiceof topic, or account for the use of certain concepts, or to provide anelementary description of either.  For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumedthat the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in informationretrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind ofretrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or thatbetween the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and theuse of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally,in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means ofcharacterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument;but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this,or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which hasraged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view ofmy main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios.
