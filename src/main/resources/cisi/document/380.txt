  Several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergenceof the field of error-correcting codes over the past two decades.Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost asdramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digitalcomputers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramaticincrease in the volume of data communicated between suchmachines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in somecases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of eithererror-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code inthe terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more economical.
