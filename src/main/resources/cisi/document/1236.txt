        This book is an attempt to trace the origins of non-book activities in public libraries, by which is meant thearrangement of fiestas, festivals, and exhibitions; theconduct of classes, contests, lectures, and excursions; thestaging of plays, the exhibition of movies, the demonstrationof karate and judo, and all similar activities not primarilyconcerned with books now carried on by public libraries.Since ideas about libraries, as well as librarians, havepassed back and forth across the Atlantic with great facility,in this attempt to discover origins it seems wise to follow,however sketchily, developments in both America and Britain,and to note with some care what was happening in scholarlylibraries, in popular libraries for the middle classes, andin libraries intended for the working classes.
