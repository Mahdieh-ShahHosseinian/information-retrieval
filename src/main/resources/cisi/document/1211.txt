  This book is intended to help campus planners, architects,and librarians in the early stages of the planning process.  Three aspects of the problem deserve more careful treatmentthan they have received.  These are: the effects of automationand electronics on planning; the overall organization of servicepatterns; and, the relevance of other audiovisual learning media.  This is a book about the planning process, not the detailsof all parts of a building.  It will not tell you which floorcovering is best, which light fixtures to use or which kind oflibrary shelving to buy.  These matters are treated in detailby Metcalf.  It will, however, try to tell you how to goabout solving these and the many other problems planners face.  Wherever it seems relevant and proper, I have included sketches to illustrate the point under discussion.  For thesimplicity of these illustrations, I beg the indulgence of thereader.
