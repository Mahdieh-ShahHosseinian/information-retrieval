  The mathematical theory of measurement is used to construct a frameworkfor the evaluation of information retrieval strategies.  The model arrived atis based on precision and recall.  After a detailed examination of the kind ofconditions the model can be expected to satisfy a plausible measure ofeffectiveness is derived.  Finally, a number of other measures are shown to bespecial cases of it.
