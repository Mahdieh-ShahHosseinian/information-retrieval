  The field of information science and technology continues to growand, as it grows, to show new emphases and explore new areas of interest.Volume 5 reflects these changes.  The increasing interest inand movement toward library networks and other cooperative,technology-supported information activities have helped to focusspecial attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology,the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems,but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications.Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the firsttime, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industrythat have had or will have a great impact on how we design and useinformation-handling systems.  Two other first-time chapters cover management information systemsand information systems in state and local government.  Whilethe intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds ofservices they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services oflibrary and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheralareas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for theAnnual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is tohelp its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solvingtechniques they are fostering.
