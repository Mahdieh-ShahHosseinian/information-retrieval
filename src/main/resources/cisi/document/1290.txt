  This paper develops a conception of ways in which certain psychosocialprocesses affect the allocation of rewards to scientists for their contributions - an allocation which in turn affects the flow of ideas andfindings through the communication networks of science.  The conceptionis based upon an analysis of the composite of experience reportedin Harriet Zuckerman's interviews with Nobel laureates in the UnitedStates (1) and upon data drawn from the diaries, letters, notebooks,scientific papers, and biographies of other scientists.
