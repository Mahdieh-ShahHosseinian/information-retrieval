   As the formal communication system of science has become less able tosupply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasingattention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How arescientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by thecirculation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the socialorganization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?   Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of thescientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of therelationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For themost part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have beenconducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, ashas been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbeyand Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack oftheory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any oneof these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge fromall three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..
