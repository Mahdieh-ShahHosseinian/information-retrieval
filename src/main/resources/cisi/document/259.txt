  The preface to the first edition of this book - which is reproducedfollowing this - shows that in 1958 the classification ideas in itwere felt to be controversial, needing to be championed.  A fewyears before, the Classification Research Group had issued amemorandum proclaiming 'the need for a faceted classificationas the basis of all methods of information retrieval.'  As part-authorof this memorandum, I must now judge the claim to have beentoo bold, even brash.  But it has been vindicated to an extent,for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis, inthe organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search,has been widely accepted - whether these vocabularies are classifiedor alphabetical, and whether used in pre- or post-coordinate fashion.
