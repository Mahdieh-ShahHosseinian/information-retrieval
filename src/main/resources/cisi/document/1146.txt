  In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluateand encourage continuing education programs incommunity hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute(PMI) has determined that there is need forguidance in the area of medical-library development.Reports from PMI physician consultants who visitedmore than 40 community hospitals indicate thatmedical-library facilities are generally poor and infrequently used by physicians.  The basicweaknesses of these libraries fall into fourcategories: inadequate collections, inadequatepersonnel, inadequate space, and the absence ofany practical indexing system to facilitate use ofcollections that do exist.  Failure to deal with these problems does notreflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulationto do so and absence of any concerted source ofguidance.  In response to requests for such guidancePMI has undertaken a community hospital librarydevelopment project in co-operation with theNew England Regional Medical Library Service(NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library ofMedicine.  This report is concerned with the firstphase of this project - namely, the formulation ofa list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks andjournals that can function as the core for a medicallibrary.  Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sentto 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medicalpractice, including the basic sciences.  Thespecialists, chosen from regions throughout thecountry, were requested to recommend two textbooksand two journals in their area of special interestthat they considered to be the most basic and fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It wasalso requested that recommendations be made in orderof preference.
