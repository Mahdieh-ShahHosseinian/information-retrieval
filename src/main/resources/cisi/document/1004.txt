  This is the third in a series of studies of the Chicago Public Library, spread over fifty years.  The first (A Library Plan for the WholeCity, adopted in 1916) proposed expansion, particularly in branch units.  The second (A Metropolitan Library in Action, completed in 1939) proposed quality, the achieving of recognized standards.  The underlying theme of the present report is adaptability, the restructuring of the Library in a period of change.   The first report, practical and pragmatic, achieved results.  The second,for all its internal excellence, had limited effect.  It is hoped thatthe present effort partakes both of the relevance of the one and of the integrity of the other.
