   A project was undertaken to discover the major determinants of the costs of searching, on-line, on a practical reference retrieval system (SCISEARCH).. Themethodology and some results of this project are reported.. Controlled searcheswere undertaken to isolate the effect of each of a number of variables.. A model involving several of the major variables was then developed.. The generalapproach proved to be (in this case) both feasible and useful..
