   A decision model for book acquisitions has been developed to simulate theintellectual processes used in acquiring these materials in academic libraries..It consists of a flow chart, weighted inputs and an equation, which when solvedindicates whether a library should add the title to its collection, refer it toa cooperative group, defer the decision or drop it altogether.. Inputs to the model need further study and development, but the model is a step in definingand quantifying the decision process..
