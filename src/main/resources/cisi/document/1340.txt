    By virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science,the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance and growth of science.  It is the means by which the individualscientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work togain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain hisknowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for the allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it isa means of exercising social control.    The informal communication system, although important, is the distaffside.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatoryrewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given bythe social system through informal systems of communication, though it isgrowing in importance as an information dissemination system.
