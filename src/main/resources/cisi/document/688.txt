  An index not only can be a creative communicationmedium, it needs to be in a research and developmentenvironment.  A creative index is achievable if therelationship and association of things and actions,one to another, can be communicated as a continuousfunction vis-a-vis the real world of science andtechnology.  A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example,ethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merelya word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  Itis a concept that he associates with or relates to aproduct, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, aproperty, etc.  It is within the semantics of hisconceptual needs that he would like to use an index to retrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more thandocuments, however, from the index.  He wants the indexto direct him to those documents which are pertinentto his problem.  He wants the index to help him togenerate thoughts and to suggest new combinations.He wants the index to help him in terms of his language,logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific approach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants theability to browse among the terms to discover the termthat is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in hismemory.  These are the criteria an index must satisfyif it is to be a creative medium of communication.
