  The deterioration of library materials, constant since libraries began, hasaccelerated to alarming proportions in 1969.  Researchers have predicted thatall paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,faceimminent ruin.  Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, mostwill not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger ofdestruction threatens not only research library collections but also the worldof knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved.Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such asfilm, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And notonly research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration ofprinted materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well.
