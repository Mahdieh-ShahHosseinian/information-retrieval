  I am going to describe in general terms a research projectwhich has been established to explore some of the problems ofthe use of the literature, particularly in the field ofBiomedical Engineering of the National Institute for MedicalResearch (Hampstead Laboratories).  The project is scheduledto last for three years, and like most research, consists ofa number of overlapping stages.  We have reached the stage nowof having acquired sufficient equipment and data to start tryingout some of our ideas.
