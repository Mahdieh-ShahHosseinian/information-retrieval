   The last ten years have witnessed the growth ofan intense public interest in university affairs.  Almost anythingto do with universities is now headline news.  Previously such attentionas they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle classnewspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once ayear by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race.All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book ThePlateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and morebesides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfishbowls.   He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: universities are of public interest because they are now almost whollysupported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investmenton the part of the government, and consequently are expected toyield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower.Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this countryon universities has risen from four million pounds a year to morethan two hundred million pounds a year.  The total university studentpopulation is in excess of two hundred thousand, and teaching andresearch staff number approximately twenty-five thousand.
