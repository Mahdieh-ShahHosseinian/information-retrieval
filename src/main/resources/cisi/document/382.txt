  This report presents the results of a detailed analysis bythe National Library of Medicine of the performance ofMEDLARS (its Medical Literature Analysis and RetrievalSystem) in relation to 300 actual requests made to thesystem in 1966 and 1967.  Thanks to this study, we now knowconsiderably more about the requirements of MEDLARS users,how well the system is meeting these requirements, and whatwe must do to improve the overall performance level.  Theinvestigation is timely:  the Library is now planning asecond-generation MEDLARS, and the design of MEDLARS IIshould benefit greatly from our knowledge of factors affectingthe performance of the present system.
