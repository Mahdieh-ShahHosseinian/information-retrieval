  In June 1965, the Acquisitions Department of The University ofMichigan Library began using a computer-based system for orderingbooks and other library materials.  This is the beginning of an over-allautomated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designedwith the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from theUniversity's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on theautomated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr.Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  Afterthe preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies weremade.  Current (i.e., 1964) volume and costs were compared with anticipatedvolume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems.
