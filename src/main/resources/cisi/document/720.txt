  The operational performance over a 17-month period of the previouslydescribed selective dissemination system is presented.  Of the 21,000 notifications sent to about 20 users, 91% were evaluated; of these, 14%were of "Document-Ordered Interest," 48% were "Of Interest," 27% were"Marginal," and 11% were "Of No Interest."  Recall data obtained fromabout half the users over a period of eight months show the precision-factor/recall-factor products are generally greater than 0.5.  Theeffect of iterative profile adjustments on precision-recall performanceis discussed.  A comparison made with four other SDI systems shows arelatively high level of performance for this system.
