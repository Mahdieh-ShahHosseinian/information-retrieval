   The new technique has been developed on the basis of an analysis of thepresent methodological requirements laid to abstracting and a study of textualrecords as modelling the real world and reflecting the logic of research..Aspects of meaning have been adopted as the invariant unit characteristicsof a document's purport.. Semantic adequacy and semantic equivalence are proposed as criteria to evaluate abstracting precision and exhaustivity..The aspect-based approach could be likewise applied to indexing of documentsand information requests.. If introduced into the practices of informationanalysis, this technique is expected to raise the standard of abstracts and the efficiency of document-oriented retrieval..
