  The task of the librarian is to achieve his library's objectives.  Asimplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectivesare defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meetthe needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in anyservice organization is likely to be an iterative process, but theexplicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept maybe) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first stepto determining policy.  Since a complete state-of-the-art in user behaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted todrawing together some threads of research of potential application inuniversity libraries.  Methodological problems are not discussed here,since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere.
