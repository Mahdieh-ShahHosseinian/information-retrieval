  This book is written in the belief that the full and speedy applicationof science in industry is necessary to economic progress, andshould indeed be one of the most important objectives of nationalpolicy.  This being so, it is important to identify the hindrances tospeedy application.  Many people have already drawn attention toparticular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this reportdid not consider that there was any up-to-date assessment of the problemwhich attempted to look at it as a whole, in all its variety and complexity.Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us;an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in Britishindustry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a firstimpression and summary.
