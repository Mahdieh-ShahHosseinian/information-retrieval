  As one of the early members of the computer community, I havebeen keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologiesin the social and behavioral sciences, and their encouragementby the data processing environment.  The economists, with an alreadyestablished mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiariesof the machine technology that enhances their ability toconstruct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statisticalmethods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual fordoctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute forone foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in anappropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French orGerman in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students atThe City University of New York and at other universities.  The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic suppliesof data, is not to reinventory the social science data archivesthat are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate theannouncements of holdings that they themselves make available to theirmembers.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature oftheir holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to thoseresearchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficientlyaware of these important resources.
