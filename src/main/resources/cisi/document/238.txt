  When is a librarian's decision not to include a book in his librarycollection an act of book selection, and when is it censorship?  Is there, in fact, any discernible difference in the two terms: book selection andcensorship?  This topic was discussed so lucidly and ably, long ago, byLester Asheim in what has become a classic essay in the literature oflibrarianship, "Not Censorship, but Selection," that raising it againmay appear to be an exercise in redundancy.
