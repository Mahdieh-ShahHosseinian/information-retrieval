  In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new techniqueof chain indexing to British libraries.  Twenty years later, with chainprocedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneereda new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its firstissues of 1971.  To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to considerthese indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handlingbibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Twoforces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subjectindexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchangenetworks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.  In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field ofsubject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to bedominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identifiedby the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabeticalfile.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good dealof Cutter's "Rules for a dictionary catalog" is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presentingit as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion ofnatural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselectedcomponent would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer alsocreated a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headingswould be co-extensive with the subject of the document.
