  Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation todaygrew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishmentsto have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technologicalinformation.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in thefield of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem isacute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these twosystems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the otherpolicy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development.  An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will bedescribed, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, thesefigures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in otherthan general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a systemmay have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assistedinformation systems may make sense within individual institutionalenvironments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linkingvarious collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operatemore efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-linenetworks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibilityof having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.
