  This is a book about what happens to people when they areoverwhelmed by change.  It is about the ways in which we adapt- or fail to adapt - to the future.  Much has been written about the future.  Yet, for the mostpart, books about the world to come sound a harsh metallic note.These pages, by contrast, concern themselves with the "soft" orhuman side of tomorrow.  Moreover, they concern themselveswith the steps by which we are likely to reach tomorrow. Theydeal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy anddiscard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit,the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.  Thefuture of friendship and family life in probed.  Strange newsubcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array ofother subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex.
