  It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journalreferences on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a smallproportion of the total titles.  Bradford listed the journals concerned in orderof decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulativetotals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced,he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many laterworkers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distributionof references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study ofliterature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these resultsBradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe referencescattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predictednot a straight line but a curve.  Kendall has now provided a more refinedstatistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford.
