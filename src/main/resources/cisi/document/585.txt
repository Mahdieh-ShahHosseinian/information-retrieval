   Arguments are advanced to suggest that information and operations on information are phenomena, the principles of which provide the basis for ametascience of information  (informatology).. The fundamental character of thephenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing andcommunication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by severalfactors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information-oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied,a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concernedin some form or other with information on one side and man's relationshipto the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascienceof information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problemsfor which the science has to provide answers and solutions.. It is suggestedthat an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of information be developed and implemented..
