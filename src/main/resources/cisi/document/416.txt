  Nearly twenty-five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed itpurely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe, and ifwe studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wontto study, say, the social behavior of bees, or the nestbuilding habits ofbirds.  The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry thatensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure ofsome fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of ourbehavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups.
