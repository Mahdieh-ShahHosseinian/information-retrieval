   In an attempt to further amplify the characteristics of the cardiovascularserial literature, citation patterns were studied.. As previously shown, one-third of the 5,860 papers from the National Heart Institute grantees for1967 appeared within 13 journals (3).. After the exclusion of the abstractjournals, the remaining journals were used to obtain a basic pool of 300cardiovascular related articles.. Science Citation Index was used togather statistics relative to citing author, journal and year.. The 300articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during thisfour-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate byyear serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak duringthe third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citationwere noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author, 15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basic journals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of thecitations were found in these journals.. Although the citations werefound throughout 349 journals, indicating an extensive scatter, arelatively high percentage of papers were found in few journals..
