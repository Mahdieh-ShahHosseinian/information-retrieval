   Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and thatcombination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since thisprocess varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayedof different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problemof literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various stepsof a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they areexpressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, theautomatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary,the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machinesto carry out a search..
