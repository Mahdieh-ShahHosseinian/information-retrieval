   A new form of document coupling called co-citation is defined as thefrequency with which two documents are cited together.. The co-citationfrequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing listsof citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical entries.. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specificscientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literatureof particle physics.. Co-citation patterns are found to differ significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agreegenerally with patterns of direct citation.. Clusters of co-citedpapers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science..They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI profiles..
