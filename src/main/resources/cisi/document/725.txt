  Some of the problems associated with present journal publications practices are discussed.  These are attributed to the fact that as the literature hasexpanded, the needs of both authors and readers are no longer being met byprinting and distributing all of the material accepted to all subscribers.A two-edition system is proposed, with short versions of papers in a broadcirculation issue and expanded versions, including full details and discussion, in library-circulation microfilm editions.  Reactions of chemists to sucha system are discussed.  It is recommended that two-edition journals bedeveloped in a evolutionary way by increasing use of the ACS mcirofilm editions for sections of articles and for supplementary documents to accompanycommunications.
