  The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set upin 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim ofestablishing close collaboration between the general research libraries ofWestern Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and inparticular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality ofthe services these libraries provide.  At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972,LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of thisseminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems ofacquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both forreference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centrefor the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provisionof bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to bea basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publicationsfrom those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards thecost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19September 1973.
