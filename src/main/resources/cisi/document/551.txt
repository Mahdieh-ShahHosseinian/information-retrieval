    In 1972-73 approximately 194,000 interlibrary loan requestswere not filled because the borrowing library in ignorancerequested non-circulating material contrary to theinterlibrary lending policies of the lending library.  Theseunfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lendinglibraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besides disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials.Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries checkin advance the lending policies before sending requests.    The major elements determining whether or not librariesreceive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance arewhether the library lists unusual materials in union lists,especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OFSERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strongcollections in a subject field listed in library directories.Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type oflending library, the size of collection, budget for current    acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopycharges, population density in neighboring states, proximityto other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings inthe National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.
