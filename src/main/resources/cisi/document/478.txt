  All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effectingretrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them.The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinatekeyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings,as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to beabsent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there isclearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer orquestioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead tofalse drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organizationof concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayedin the form of groupings called classes.
