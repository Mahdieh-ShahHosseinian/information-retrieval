  The Science Citation Index is a valuable and powerful tool whenused for the purpose for which it was intended, as an aid in literaturesearch.  It also invites a variety of statistical investigations, whichmust, however, be considered with prudence, since they may lead tomisleading results.  No matter how cautiously the authors expressthemselves, the casual readers,  that is the majority, will treat the results as established facts and forget about the assumptionsunderlying them.  This is also happening with the computer outputfor economic models, which is accepted as if it were experimentalobservation.
