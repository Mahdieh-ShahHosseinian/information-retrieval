  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science tokeep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, thepublication of collected papers, like the estate of holymatrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly,lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have beenconsidered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respectedfriend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragementalone overcame that distaste which most of us feelfor our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought thisfirst volume to the point of no return.  It is true that theseexploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting tofollow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them werewritten for specific occasions, each of which demanded somerehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resultingrepetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasionalexceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated onlyat the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solutionadopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passagesintact, offsetting in small print those that can be skippedwithout loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where somecomment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or postscript to the original papers, the passages added havebeen italicized.
