  In the late 1960s nearly all professions in the United States thoughtthey faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields, both in professionaland supporting areas.  Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to bedone than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacanciesthat could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietlyexpressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changedutilization of existing manpower.  It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, thenpresident of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committeeon Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignmentsand to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizingprofessional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a fewlibraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchersthat they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that aneed was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem couldbe more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois mighthave national implications, and that the resources for such a study should besought.
