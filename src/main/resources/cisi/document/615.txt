   This paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how to minimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system.. Through the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparativeevaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides thecosts of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performancelevel of the system and the combination of user and systems time that isexpended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost ofoperating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance leveland for a given cost per unit of user and system time..
