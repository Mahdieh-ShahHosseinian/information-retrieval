  The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS) is themachine-readable equivalent of Current Abstracts inChemistry & Index Chemicus (CAC & IC).  In an earlierpaper, we described the development of an experimentalselective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) servicebased on these tapes.  A detailed description of thetechniques of profile construction for searching aWiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given inthis earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluationof the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measuresof retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also ofuser reactions to the service, as expressed in their repliesto a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used toidentify the reasons for retrieval failures and possiblemethods for improving retrieval performance.  A fullerdescription of the evaluation has been published in reportform.
