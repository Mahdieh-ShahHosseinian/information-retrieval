   A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems wereexamined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measuresand a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the mainexperiment the effect on performance of the following variableswas tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes,question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. Inaddition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigatethe problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The mainconclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in allcomponents of an IR system; length of indexes affects performanceconsiderably more than indexing languages; question analyses and searchstrategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  morethan indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present onlyon a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific..It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring allfactors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..
