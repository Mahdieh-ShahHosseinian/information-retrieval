  I see from the programme that I am supposed to talk on an information  language for MARC, and it is true that the work I have been doing for the pastyear or so has been under the auspices of the MARC Project.  But the subjectindexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB's plans forcomputer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope toshow that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatiblegeneral system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, itis necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work whichcaused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how thecomputer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing.
