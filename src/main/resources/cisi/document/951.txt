  The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are naturalconsequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more andmore knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests oftheir clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in theincreasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processesare of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large libraryis, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for itspredecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research librariesthat is spent for the processing of material, as distinguishedfrom the costs of its purchase or its directservicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come whennearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processingmaterial, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!
