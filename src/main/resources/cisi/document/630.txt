   The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of informationstorage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer isrecognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effectivealternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalentphilosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designerstouted the computer as the answer to all information storage andretrieval situations.. Important principles of information systemdesign incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophyfor the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users'needs studies by the representative small group technique; theanalysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitableexistent information storage and retrieval system from those available; the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishinga model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the finaldesign of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising fromearlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of thesepitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed..
