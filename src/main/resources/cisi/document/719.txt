Scientists are worried about the "information explosion" and the amount ofpublished literature that could have a significant impact on their work. Onething that can help is a condensation and evaluation of the published material.This is the task of reviews, and without them, the other tools for dealing withthe information explosion will be inadequate. Suggestions are made on ways forauthors and editors to make their reviews more eccessible and more useful and on the need for better education of users.
