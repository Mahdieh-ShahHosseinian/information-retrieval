  The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCMand PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio hasintensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis forsuch a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartleyon this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include anumber of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, andthe savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original messageand due to the nature of the final destination of the information.  The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing atone point either exactly or approximately a message selected at anotherpoint.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptualentities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to theengineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message isone selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designedto operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actuallybe chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.
