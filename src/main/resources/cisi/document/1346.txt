   This paper reports correlates of departmental prestige (American Council onEducation rating of the quality of graduate faculty, 1966) for a sample of 125departments in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.. The analysis mostly uses multivariate linear regression.. Large and significant correlationswith departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, researchproduction, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality ofPhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six tonine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the variance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are heldconstant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantlyassociated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates ofinbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differencesin the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied.. It isshown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientificcommunication and with departmental morale even after possible confoundingvariables are held constant..
