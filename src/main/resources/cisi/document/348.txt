  The Ohio College Library Center is developinga computerized, user-oriented, library systemthat will improve efficiency of library use andoperations; that will increase availability oflibrary resources within a region; and that will facilitateevolution of new and easier accesses to information inlibraries.  The center does not conceive of its task as beingmerely the mechanization of library procedures of the past.  For the immediate future, the principal academic objectiveof the center is to increase the availability of libraryresources for use in educational and research programs incolleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distantobjective is to enable libraries to participate actively in theprograms of instruction and research in their institutions.The passive service functions that libraries have developedduring the past century are proving inadequate to meet thepresent demands made of libraries, and will be increasinglyinadequate in the future.  The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhatmore than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the generaleconomy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of theOhio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of riseof per-student costs, so that the rate of increase willapproximate that of the economy as a whole.
