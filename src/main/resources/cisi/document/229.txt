  In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where thesignals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast withthe discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent thecontinuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discretecase by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finitenumber of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved ona discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters ingeneral approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  Thereare, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change ofemphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results toparticular cases.  We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results withthe greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, sincethis would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and wouldobscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however,indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic andrigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases andmany others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in thepresent analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.
