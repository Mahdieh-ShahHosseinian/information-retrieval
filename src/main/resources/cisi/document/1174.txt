   Syntagmatic relations (SR) are defined as connections between words that areestablished aposteriori and combine these words into phrases and sentences..The lack of means for recording SR in descriptor languages results in a reduction of retrieval precision.. At present, roles and links and the evaluation of the extent to which these devices are used are the major devicesused for the description of SR between descriptors in documents' search patterns.. An analysis of published results of experiments testing the performance of roles and links in 176 descriptor retrieval systems operative inthe USA suggests the conclusion about a poor performance of roles as a precision device:  an increase of 10 percent in precision with the aid of rolesis accompanied by a 10 percent reduction of recall.. Links provide for approximately the same increase of precision.. The author states the generalrequirements to a simple and flexible grammar for descriptor languages, andshow that the approach the suggest ts has been partially implemented in theinformation retrieval language for radioelectronics and computer technologydeveloped at the Institute of Cybernetics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciencesin Kiev, and in the SYNTOL (France)..
