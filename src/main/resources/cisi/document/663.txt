   This study reports the results of a series of experiments in the techniquesof automatic document classification.. Two different classification schedules are compared along with two methods of automatically classifying documents into categories.. It is concluded that, while there is no significant difference in the predictive efficiency between the Bayesian and the factor score methods, automatic document classification is enhanced by the use of a factor-analytically-derived classification schedule.. Approximately 55 percent of the documents were automatically and correctly classified..
