  A computer program is described which generates a connectivity matrix usingas input an unmodified Wiswesser notation.  This program records the topologyof a molecule as a statement of the atoms and their connectivity.  One symbolis used to represent each atom and this symbol is descriptive of the atom andits bonds.  The network of a complex molecule is recorded as a series of interruptions in an assumed linear path.  The application of this matrix toinformation handling of chemical structures is described in a subsequent paper.
