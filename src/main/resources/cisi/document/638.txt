   Chen's data for the raw frequency of use of 138 physics journals in thescience library at M I T are re-examined and converted to densities ofuse-per-meter of shelf.. Other units of size for obtaining densities,and their measurement are discussed.. There is no evidence for synchronousobsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there issome statistically significant evidence of greater density of use withgreater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order forheaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequenciesto densities of use..    It is suggested that, for comparing the relative values of differentjournals, or age groups, in library use or citation studies, analyses ofraw frequencies are valueless, and indeed potentially dangerously misleading, until they are converted to allow for the numbers of available items in each group examined..
