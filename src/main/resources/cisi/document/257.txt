  The role of classification schemes in libraries and information serviceshas probably caused more argument than any other professional activity.This would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairlyconvenient way of arranging books on shelves.  Some librarians think it is,and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like theClassification Research Group, actually spend years of their time intheoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse anddifficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise.Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the libraryscene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the DecimalClassification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography)for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians,and still more information officers, are busy revising the UniversalDecimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.  In the nextfield, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are poundingaway at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results thatimpress computer specialists but not information users, who are so deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new.
