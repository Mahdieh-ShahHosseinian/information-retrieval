  Two recent articles in this journal (Konigova [1], Cooper [2]) have gonebeyond the usual slapdash use of the words "relevant" and "relevance," andhave attempted to explicate the concept further.  Both attempts only partiallysucceed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/contentrelevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification hasvalidity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a lessprecise language; for example, in defining "second order noise," she uses theambiguous phrase "a formally relevant document which is not really relevant" -presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need ofthe enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, "no account is taken ofthe subjective relevance (pertinence)."  Yet this is surely the true aim of thesystem.
