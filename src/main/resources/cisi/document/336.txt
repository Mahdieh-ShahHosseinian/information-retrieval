    This work describes a conceptual design of an automatednational library system.  The design is "conceptual" in that it isintended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather thanprovide a detailed engineering design.  The design concerns anautomated national library system but does not attempt to automateall parts of the system.  It is primarily concerned with the functions ofbibliographic searching, acquisition, circulation, and cataloging.  Ifthese functions can be economically automated, the major problemsassociated with our information explosion will be solved.
