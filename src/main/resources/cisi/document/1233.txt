   Multidimensional scaling is the problem of representing n objects geometrically by n points, so that the interpoint distances correspond in somesense to experimental dissimilarities between objects.. In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague inmost approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete.. Ourfundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonicallyrelated.. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodnessof fit to this hypothesis.. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit..A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in acompanion paper..
