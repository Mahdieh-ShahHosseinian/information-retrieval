   The first part of this paper considers three general approaches to thedevelopment of an automation program in a large research library.. The librarymay decide simply to wait for developments; it may attempt to develop a total or integrated system from the start; or it may adopt an evolutionary approachleading to an integrated system.. Outside consultants,it is suggested, will become increasingly important.. The second part of the paper deals with important elements in any program regardless of the approach.. These includethe building of a capability to do automation work, staffing, equipment,organizational structure, selection of projects, and costs..
