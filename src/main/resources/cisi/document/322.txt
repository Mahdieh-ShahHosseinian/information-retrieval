  This study deals with the learning resources programs of the publictwo-year colleges.  In former years, these institutions were commonlycalled junior colleges, and the college departments or divisions thatassembled, organized, and interpreted the learning resources (mainlybooks) were commonly called libraries.  In keeping with traditionalterminology I could have chosen "The Junior College Library" as thetitle for the study; however, I decided to modify the title to make itcorrespond more closely to prevailing current terminology.
