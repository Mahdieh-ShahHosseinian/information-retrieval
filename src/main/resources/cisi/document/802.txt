  The term 'informatics' was first advanced formally by the Directorof Viniti, A.I. Mikhailov, and his colleagues A.I. Chernyi and R.S.Gilyarevskii, in their paper Informatics - new name for the theory of ScientificInformation published at the end of 1966.  An English translation wascircularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper,they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by ProfessorJ.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information inwhich Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation','documentalistics', 'information science', and so on.  Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that Informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information,only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitionsfor 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity','information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up theirproposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, andthe title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal,which is now called Informatiki.
