  The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for onlytwo decades.  During most of this time, computer scientists haveconcentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronictechnology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturingthe hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computingpower is made available through interactive terminals to people whoare not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale onlybecause design and marketing innovators now have confidence in theirability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticatedusers.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users becomean important element in the design of the interface to the tool.
