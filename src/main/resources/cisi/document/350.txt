  "Design" is used throughout in its most generic sense,to include planning, operations research, engineering design,architectural design, programming, budgeting, and all the otheractivities in which we consciously attempt to change ourselves and ourenvironment to improve the quality of our lives.  So the book could beread as a philosophy of organization theory, or of architectural orengineering design, or of operations research, or of planning.  The word "inquiry" suggests that the audience includes personsinterested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as theinterest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science withrespect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and soon.  Inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science.  Icould have called the book The Design of Systems, but this would notadequately reflect my style, which is to proceed from the more specificproblem of inquiry to the "whole system."
