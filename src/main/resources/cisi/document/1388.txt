  In doing sociology, lay and professional, every reference to the"real world," even where the reference is to physical or biologicalevents, is a reference to the organized activities of everyday life.Thereby, in contrast to certain versions of Durkheim that teach thatthe objective reality of social facts is sociology's fundamentalprinciple, the lesson is taken instead, and used as study policy, thatthe objective reality of social facts as an ongoing accomplishmentof the concerted activities of daily life, with the ordinary, artfulways of that accomplishment being by members known, used, adtaken for granted, is, for members doing sociology, a fundamentalphenomenon.  Because, and in the ways it is practical sociology'sfundamental phenomenon, it is the prevailing topic for ethno-methodologicalstudy.  Ethnomethodological studies analyze everyday activities asmembers' methods for making those same activities visibly-rational- and-reportable-for-all-practical-purposes, i.e., "accountable," asorganizations of commonplace everyday activities.  The reflexivityof that phenomenon is a singular feature of practical actions, ofpractical circumstances, of common sense knowledge of social structures,and of practical sociological reasoning.  By permitting us to locateand examine their occurrence the reflexivity of that phenomenon establishestheir study.
