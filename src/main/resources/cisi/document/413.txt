    This is a revision and enlargement of Origins of the American LibrarySchool.    Someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in thepast and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came tobe what it is.  This study is less a descriptive history of library schoolsand their work than a search for perspective within which major problems,as well as the course pursued in resolving them, can be more fullyunderstood.  The original study, begun in 1941-42, sought to throw lighton how library education at that time came to be what is was.  Thepresent study continues beyond the early forming of the American libraryschool to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization.  A newtitle is used to reflect the broadened scope.
