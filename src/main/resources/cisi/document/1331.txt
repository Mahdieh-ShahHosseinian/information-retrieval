  Baboons have adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from WestAfrican rain forests to semidesert areas on the coast of the Red Sea.While all baboons are morphologically adapted to life on the ground,some species have become more independent of trees than others.In a rough ecological series, we find on one end the forest dwellingWest African Species (Mandrillus leucophaneus, M. sphinx, Papiopapio), none of which has so far been studied in the field.  The firststep into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of Southand East Africa, including, from south to north, the species Papioursinus, cynocephalus and anubis.  Their social organization and itsecological context have been subject to long range field work byHALL (1962 a, b) in South Africa, by DEVORE (1962) in Kenya, andby ALTMANN and ALTMANN (in preparation) in Kenya ad Tanzania.In both regions, the groups can range far into the open grassland,but at night, they withdraw to high trees or, as in the Cape region,to vertical cliffs.
