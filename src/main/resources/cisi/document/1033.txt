  The purpose of this book is to inquire into the validity of the viewson human nature expressed in the widely read and influential booksof Robert Ardrey and Konrad Lorenz.  Ardrey's books are AfricanGenesis (Atheneum, 1961), and The Territorial Imperative (Atheneum,1966).  Lorenz's book is On Aggression (Harcourt, Brace & World,1966).  In these books the authors argue that man is byinstinct an aggressive creature, and it is this innate propensity toviolence that accounts for individual and group aggression in man.
