  The field of documentation originated from the desire of librariansto arrange the document collection by subject areas.  Mono-DicraredicalClassification systems were developed for this purpose which made itpossible in each case to find a single clearly defined category for eachbibliographic item.  The development of modern science has brought abouttwo principal changes in the situation:  First it is no longer enough to simply provide for the retrievalof complete bibliographic items as a unit, but rather one tends more andmore to request informational details that may be contained in the book.Second, modern knowledge has become too complex and interdependent that it is no longer possible to provide a single well-defined category for the books orjournal articles.
