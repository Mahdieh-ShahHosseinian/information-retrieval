  This book is concerned primarily with those "intellectual" factors thatsignificantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems;namely,        - indexing policy and practice        - vocabulary control        - searching strategies        - interaction between the system and its users  My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.  I havetherefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirementsof users of information systems and the measurement of system performancein terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.  The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipmentfor the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequatelycovered by other volumes in this seris.  Moreover, it is my contention thatthe importance of "hardware" and "data processing" aspects of informationsystems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detrimentto the performance of many systems.
