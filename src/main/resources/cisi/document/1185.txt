   What organizational characteristics are required to deal effectively withdifferent external market and technological conditions?  This is the central question which this book addresses.. Such a question is quite different fromthe central theme of most earlier organizational studies, which have tendedto focus on the question of what is the one best way to organize, irrespectiveof the external environmental conditions facing the business.. In this important respect this study breaks new ground.. Nevertheless, it drawsheavily on earlier studies in the field of organization behavior at HarvardBusiness School and elsewhere, as well as the related literature of the behavioral sciences.. The authors not only report the findings of a comparativestudy of ten organizations with different levels of economic performance in three distinct industrial environments, but also use these findings to unravelsome of the apparent contradictions in current organization theory.. A discussion of the implications of these findings for the design and administration of large organizations in relation to their specific market andtechnological environments is also included..
