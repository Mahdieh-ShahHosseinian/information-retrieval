  In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications ofinformation science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so much difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one shouldnot be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and,as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors areeliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageableproportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort ofhypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtainingevidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence uponwhich to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, oneis ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in afully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or humansituation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this doesnot alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodologylacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.
