    The notion of a Plan that guides behavior is, again not entirelyaccidentally, quite similar to the notion of a program that guides anelectronic computer.  In order to discover how to get the Image intomotion, therefore, we reviewed once more the cybernetic literatureon the analogies between brains and computers, between minds andprograms.    Our fundamental concern, however, was to discover whetherthe cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology.  The menwho have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocentabout psychology - the creatures whose behavior they want tosimulate often seem more like a mathematician's dream than likeliving animals.  But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or even an advantage.  There must be some way to phrase the new ideas so that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior that psychologists have created.  It was the search for that favorable intersection that directed the course of our year-long debate.
