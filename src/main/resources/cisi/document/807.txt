   Terminalogy and parameters for describing the relation between figures forthe use of library literature and for its age are discussed.. Unless a correction for growth is applied, half-life fails a simple test of suitability,as do Brookes's aging and utility factors.. Results based on cumulated datahave other important disadvantages.. Relative 'use-per-item' figures are satisfactory.. The need to relate terminology more closely to the facts theyrepresent is stressed: item-consultation decay rate, and 50% consultation probability age are suggested and defined.. In the context of citation studies,item-citation decay rate and 50% citation probability age are equivalent and avoid similar objections..   In data from NRLSI, item-consultation decay rates are only approximately exponential.. Different rates are demonstrated for updating and basic searches,for academic and other types of readers, and for types of literature.. For somehistorical searches negative decay rates were found in the NRLSI and BML..
