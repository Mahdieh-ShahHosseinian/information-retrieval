  The two major problems of the present system are (1) the unequaldistribution of lending, with a few of the largest libraries handlinga large proportion of the requests, and (2) the difficulty of fillingrequests which are incomplete, incorrect, or inadequately checked.  Solutions proposed for these two problems have been (1)compensation to the largest libraries for each transaction, and (2)better bibliographic checking of requests before they are forwarded tothe lending library.
