   The purpose of this project was to identify variables thought to affect relevance judgements and conduct a series of laboratory studies to determinethe effects of these variables on relevance judgements.. This paper discussesthe variable of 'implicit use orientations' - the particular attitude taken bya subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and fortyjudges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. Itwas found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and thattheir study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under whichone person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another..   Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed toevaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgementshave usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarilyobtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions ofmeasurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluationstudies..
