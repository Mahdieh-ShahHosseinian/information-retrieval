  Three types of current awareness publicationsare defined in terms of their generationand distribution characteristics.  Thesetypes are the SDI type, the intermediate typesuch as NASA's SCAN program, and the unselectedtype such as the usual library accessionlist.  A fourth type, the indexing andabstracting journal is defined but not relatedto the other three types.  The three currentawareness publications are shown to have arelationship in terms of the number ofrequests they can produce from a given set ofreferences or notices.  The SDI system willproduce about one request from ten notices;the intermediate type about one request perhundred notices; ad the unselected type,one request per thousand notices.  Despitethe differences in the number of notices togenerate one request, the cost to produce onerequest is about the same for the three typesof tools.  Also, the usage of these tools isrelated to the amount of user time availableand a curve is presented based on variousassumptions to define this relationship.
