However, the research reported herein is a preliminaryattempt to understand and define some basic problems that must be solved if computers are ever to aid the historian of science - no less supplant him.In this study, it was necessary to select a recent important scientificbreakthrough which was based on the cumulation of years of diversescientific achievement.  For this reason we selected the discovery of theDNA code.  For a concise historical description of the events, we thenselected "The Genetic Code," a book by Dr. Isaac Asimov which describesthe major scientific developments that eventually led to the duplicationin the laboratory of the process of protein synthesis under control of DNA.
