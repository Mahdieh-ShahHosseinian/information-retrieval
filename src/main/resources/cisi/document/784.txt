  I would suggest three possible reasons for the constant average number ofreferences per article.  Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen yearsold rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  Thenet increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwisebe expected.  Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending tohave its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off fromthe classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.  Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on averagebe adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information)by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the maintheme, associated concepts and methods, and general background.
