  Since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year(measured by counts of titles abstracted) has grown from about 800to 13,000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2.5 percentper year, doubling about four times a century.  Deviations from theexponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If thetotal number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating fromthe curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titlesgrows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations froman exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two"pauses" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallelto the theoretical curve.  The well-known hypothesis of exponentialgrowth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate lessthan half that found by Price and other investigators.	The discrepancy appearsto be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account thetitles published before the beginnings of the time series used.
