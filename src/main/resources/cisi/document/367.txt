  This report attempts to present and interpret current(Winter 1968-69) information on the economics of book storagein relation to the other factors a university administratormust consider in developing a program for housing anever-growing book collection when there are present orfuture limitations on space and money.  The study will attempt to answer two specific questions:1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to selectso-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks andstore them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one auniversity need consider in adopting a storage program; and,if not, how is cost related to the others?  The facts and conclusions in this report are based onthe library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovationsin computer applications and other technologies couldpresumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, butit is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely tooccur within the next 5 to 10 years.
