  Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literaturefor the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at leastthree dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs ofscientists and engineers for information, of their information gatheringhabits, and the use to which they put information.  Some of these have been concerned with the people in individualorganizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, includingAslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have beenbased upon observations and records of what the scientists andengineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demandsthey made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions,and collections of facts.
