                It is only in the last eight or ten years that thenumerical aspects of bibliography have attracted attention, althoughsome of the numerical regularities that occur in bibliography have beenknown for thirty or forty years.  Results are, therefore, still meagerand applications are still few.  Moreover, most of the work so far reported has been limited to numerical analysis of the literature of thenatural sciences.  This is in part because the secondary sources in thenatural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessibledata; in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the leastrestricted by linguistic barriers; and in part because the proposed world-wide systems, such as those advocated in the UNISIST report, offer animmediate field of application in the design of economic and efficientsystems based on the results of numerical bibliographic analysis.  However,the field of possible application is gradually widening: serious efforts arenow being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the socialsciences, for example.
