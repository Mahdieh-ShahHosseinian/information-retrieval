   Successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavilydependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in theparticular language of the system and on the predictability of thisrepresentation..    If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed andthe quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelityof the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptualdistortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The variousindex languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differencesin their performance are correspondingly great..   The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languagesis due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationshipsamong concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing andretrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such agraph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between thesepoints represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry,these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of adocument to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural languagetext..
