    The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries andwith the factors that appear to be requirements for effectiveprograms.  In the absence of established standards or criteria formeasuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis ofa number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process;a survey of needs and interests of thetarget groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of thelibrary's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by othercommunity institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis forcomparisons and for judgements has been introduced which providesa foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programsof service to the disadvantaged might move.  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practicesin low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview andobservation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests ofthe community residents, (2) library services in relation to otheravailable community resources, (3) the nature and scope of theneighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of thelibrary system, and (4) available measures of the impact oreffectiveness of the program.
