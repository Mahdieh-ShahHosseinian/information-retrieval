  This paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to thedecision problems of the recipient.  The orientation is toward a formaldefinition of behavioral elements in an individual's "purposeful state":specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of eachobjective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course ofaction in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for eachcourse of action.  The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined interms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action.The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between theamount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and theamount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message.  The amountof instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficienciesof the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined interms of the values of the objectives.	The amounts of instruction and motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing theamounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.  The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function ofthe amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount ofmotivation in the state.  This concept can be generalized to express the valueof the state to some other individual.
