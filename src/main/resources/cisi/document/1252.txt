    Stock control has been defined by Buckland as "the managerialproblem of organising the physical availability of books in relationto readers".  While it has long been recognised that only a proportionof the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness withremarkable speed.  In certain cases some new buildings are full evenbefore they have left the design-board stage.  It is difficult to avoidthe conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that 'in terms of longrange perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is nofeasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuousprogramme of "selective book retirement"'.  Library stock controlhas not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy,time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problemsof acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services for readers.  Early investigations of this issue have tended to betheoretical and Carol Seymour in her review "Weeding the Collection"put forward the view that "a librarian should be able to begin his planfor weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary...He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have athand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden".  The Pebul Reportsummarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when itobserved that "weeding the bookstock" in academic libraries was the"ungrasped nettle."
