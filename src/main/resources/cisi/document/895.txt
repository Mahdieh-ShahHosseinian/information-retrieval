  This study was undertaken to meet more fully the demands forimproved and expanded training of library personnel, especially at themiddle and upper levels, occasioned by the rapidly changing roles andfunctions of libraries as they try to adapt to the vast social, economic,and technological changes currently in progress.  The rise to a higherlevel of required skills and competencies - often new - has brought aboutan urgent need for improved training beyond the first professionaldegree at the post-master's level.  The basic purpose of this research iscurriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip themiddle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confrontingthem.  Although it would be possible to restructure the master's programand add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternativehas not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculumis widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the newcourses are designed for a different group of students - experiencedlibrarians.
