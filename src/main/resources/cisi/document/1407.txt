  In 1963 research at the Harvard Business School was initiatedby Richard Rosenbloom and Frank Wolek to describe the processby which technical information is communicated and used.  Nationaland corporate attention had been increasingly drawn to theinteraction between scientific and technological advance and socialchange.  This problem was considered to be of considerablepractical importance at that time, as it still is.  This volumeis a product of that effort.  The research focuses upon the flow oftechnical information across organizational lines in the research anddevelopment operations of large industrial corporations.  The basis ofthe work is a body of survey data collected from 2,000 engineers andscientists in 13 establishments of 4 corporations, and from 1,200members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.The data describe instances in which respondents acquired usefultechnical information from sources outside their immediate circleof colleagues.  The analysis is descriptive in character, following afunctional approach in which the use of various means of informationtransfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technicalwork.
