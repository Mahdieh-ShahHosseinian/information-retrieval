	The increasing volume of published literature continues to presentproblems in relation to information handling and information representation.As the magnitude and complexity of the available information has continuedto increase, investigators have examined means of reducing the costly andtime-consuming processes involved when human beings assign index terms todocuments.  Recognition of the general inadequacy of present indexing, andconcern over time and cost factors in index preparation have promptedexperimentation in the development and application of machines to assistin the indexing process.  As a result, use of suitable mechanized or partlymechanized procedures to replace or complement the manual indexing processhas become more widespread.  Machine indexing is a process whereby mechanizedor automatic selection or generation of indexing terms is accomplished.  Thepresent study investigates one aspect of automatic computer-based indexing,the permuted title index.
