  An industrial society has an open class stratification system; itoffers some an opportunity to rise, but it offers no guarantee againstdownward social mobility.  Compared to other types of societies, this onedemands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates muchpressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual in his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modernindustrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills of a high order.  Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts torise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income.
