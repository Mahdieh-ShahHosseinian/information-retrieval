This article discusses the possibility of exploiting thestatistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes ofdocument retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and relatedto the mental processes of authors and readers; severalmeans of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrenceare then scrutinized.  It is shown that the moststrongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore"associated" in a statistical sense, can be representedin the form of an "association map."  The last half of thearticle presents two modes of use of association mapsin literature searching.
