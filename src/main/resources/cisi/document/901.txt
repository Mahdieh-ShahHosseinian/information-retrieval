  The three chapters of this book are somewhat elaborated versions ofthree lectures, the Beckman lectures, that I delivered at the Universityof California, at Berkeley, in January 1967.  The first is an attempt toevaluate past contributions to the study of mind that have been been basedon research and speculation regarding the nature of language.  The second isdevoted to contemporary developments in linguistics that have a bearing onthe study of the mind.  The third is a highly speculative discussion ofdirections that the study of language and mind might take in coming years.The three lectures, then, are concerned with the past, the present, andthe future.
