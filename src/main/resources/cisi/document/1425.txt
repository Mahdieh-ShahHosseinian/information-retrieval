  With the advent of individual detribalized man, a neweducation was needed.  Plato devised such a new program for literate men.  It was based on the Ideas.  With thephonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from theoperational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal encyclopedia.  Education by classified data has been theWestern program ever since.  Now, however, in the electronic age, data classificationyields to pattern recognition, the key phrase at IBM.  Whendata moves instantly, classification is too fragmentary.  Inorder to cope with data at electric speed in typical situationsof "information overload," men resort to the study of configurations,like the sailor in Edgar Allan Poe's Maelstrom.  "The medium is the message" means, in terms of the electronicage, that a totally new environment has been created.  The "content"of this new environment is the old mechanized environment ofthe industrial age.
