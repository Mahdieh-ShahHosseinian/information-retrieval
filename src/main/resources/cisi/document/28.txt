  Recently a number of articles, books, and reportsdealing with information systems, i.e., document retrievalsystems, have advanced the doctrine that such systemsare to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentageof relevancy they provide.  Although there seems to be little agreement on whatrelevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable,there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixedand formal relationship exists between the relevance andthe recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will findin the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations,curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably providenumerical measures of the recall and relevancecharacteristics of information systems.  This phenomenonof shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjectiveand non-mathematical term to equations in which thesame term is given a mathematical value or a mathematicaldefinition has its ancient parallel in discussionsof probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate themeaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,on "who is master," the user or the term.  On the other hand,the use of a single term in the same document to covertwo or more distinct meanings, especially when such ausage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrineby attributing to it mathematical validity which it doesnot have, represents a more serious situation than merelycareless ambiguity.
