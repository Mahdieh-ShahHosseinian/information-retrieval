  A characteristic of inventory in business or industryis that approximately 80 percent of the number oftransactions taken from a warehouse represents about20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also beconsidered as a ranking of stock items by theirtransaction activity which will show that the top 20percent of the stocked items (i.e., the most activeitems) account for about 80 percent of the totalnumber of transactions.  The rule is sometimesexpressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation.It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100as the phenomena relate to the relationships betweenthe two statistical measures.
