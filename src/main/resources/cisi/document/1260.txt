  The collection includes (1) simple parent rings and (2) parent systems ofmore than one ring in which the rings are united by having one or more atomsin common.  It thus comparizes simple and "fused" (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused), or annelated, systems (including spiro forms),  but not systems like biphenylor triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atomsnot belonging to the rings.  Some systems are included in which a polar valenceis involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shownin formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bondis noted.  Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelatecompounds).  The word "system" is used to mean a single ring or a combination ofrings united one to another by atoms common to both.  Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compoundsof generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have acertain structure, are included.  The fact that a compound must have one or twoalternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based oneither of them.  Where there is doubt about an entry a query (?) is insertedafter the reference.
