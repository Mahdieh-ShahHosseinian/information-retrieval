    This volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that thehuman side of enterprise is "all of a piece" - that the theoreticalassumptions management holds about controlling its human resourcesdetermine the whole character of the enterprise.  They determinealso the quality of its successive generations of management.    Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibilityand the hope of future progress.  The key question for top managementis:  "What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) aboutthe most effective way to manage people?"  From the answer to thisquestion flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in ourdiscussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to manyother questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks toachieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  Itwill be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptionsabout the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate.
