  Over the last several decades interest in economic development,population growth, and the world environment has expanded rapidly.As world-wide stresses have increased, many individuals and organizations have begun to study and to influence the changingaspects of the world situation.  But it seems fair to observethat most of the activity has been addressed to separate facetsof the world system.  Little has yet been done to show how the manyactions and forces are affecting one another to produce the totalconsequences that we observe.  Now however, many persons are comingto believe that the interactions within the whole are more importantthan the sum of the separate parts.  This book was undertaken as onestep toward showing how the behavior of the world system results frommutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agriculturalsubsystems.
