  An examination made over a period of years of the principles ofclassifying law books for use in libraries, and of their treatment inmany general and specialized classification schemes convinced me thatno scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in English-speaking countries outside the United States.  Law collections inacademic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth werein a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting oneof the good American schemes, which generally make inadequateprovision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or ofadopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailoredto a particular library, and several of which are even less well suitedto overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  Thereseemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification schemecapable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, generaland special, academic and professional, in these countries.
