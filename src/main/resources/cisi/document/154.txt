  Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or somesuch title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there willhardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in thehalf-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able toconvince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that theUDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some ofits severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar asit once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, butthat it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may begauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for thedistribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number ofusers throughout the world.
