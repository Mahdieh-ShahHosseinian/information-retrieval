  This book is directed both to advanced college studentsenrolled in sociology courses and to students of the othersocial sciences (such as anthropology, economics, history,and psychology) who are concerned with diffusion.  (For this reason, sociological concepts are defined when they areintroduced.)  More than five hundred publications on the diffusion ofinnovations are reviewed here.  The innovations studied rangefrom new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitivetribes, and from driver training among public high schools to hybrid corn among farmers.  Although a generallyconsistent set of findings has emerged from these studies, asearch of the literature shows little attempt to summarize andevaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas.This volume synthesizes these findings and theories.
