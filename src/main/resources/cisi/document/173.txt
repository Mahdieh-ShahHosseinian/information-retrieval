  This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is notsimply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive bodyof information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively newconcept - the rise of an "anthropological" species we call theauthoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older stylehe seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proudto be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to powerand authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflictingtrends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers andpolitical thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means ofsocio-psychological research.
