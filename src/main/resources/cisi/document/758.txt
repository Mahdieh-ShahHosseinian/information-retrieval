   A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification..Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates,and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only fourbasic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, andcausation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in alinear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutationsof such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then beconstructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such aninductively constructed classification is the only true representation of thestructure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple techniquefor accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, withcomplete flexibility..
