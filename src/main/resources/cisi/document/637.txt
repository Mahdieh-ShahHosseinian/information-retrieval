   The challenges of design of programming systems, file organizationand manipulation, and user-oriented query languages have held the spotlightin the development of data processing support to systems for retrieval ofscientific literature.. At BIOSIS, development of such a system from thepragmatic viewpoint of providing viable self-supporting retrieval servicefrom a data base of more than two million references has resulted infocusing attention on supporting the formulation of the information need intoan effective computer search specification.. Developed under CPS and nowimplemented under CICS, the program claims no novelty of structure or technique, but constitutes an innovation in application and goal with primaryemphasis on accommodating the behavior of a user not previously knowledgeableabout the structure, indexing language, and detailed content of a machinebased references file..
