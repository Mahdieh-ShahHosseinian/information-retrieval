  The fundamental principles of reference work remainmore or less constant through the years, but the rapidexpansion of the publication of reference books in allfields makes essential a careful selection to fit the needsof each library.  The purpose of this volume is to listreference books basic to research - general and special -and thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for thelibrary assistant, research worker, or other user oflibrary resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and(3) a textbook for the student, who, either in libraryschool, training class, or college course in bibliography,is pursuing a systematic study of reference books.  The needs of these types of users have influenced theorganization and make-up of this volume, in that therequirements of the first two groups have made themanual more comprehensive than it might have been ifintended for a textbook only, while the introductions tosections and many of the annotations have been providedparticularly for the library school student.
