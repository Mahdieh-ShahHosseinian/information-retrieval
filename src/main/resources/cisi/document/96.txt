  The preceding papers have addressed themselvesto the study of information flow in a particularstream of human activity which has been variously calledscience, pure science, basic research, orfundamental research, and whichis only secondarily, if at all, concernedwith the practical utilization of its products.At this point it is appropriate to note that there isa parallel activity which includes applied research,exploratory development, and engineering development.This second stream of research we will call technology.Far more is known about the flow of informationamong scientists than among technologists.  Fromthe knowledge that is available, however, we areled to conclude that the communication patterns  in the two areas of activity are not only largelyindependent of one another, but qualitativelydifferent in their nature.  This difference isreflected most clearly in the mechanisms bywhich information is diffused within the twosets of practitioners.  The present paper isaddressed to these differences and to a discussionof the nature of the communication process betweenscience and technology.
