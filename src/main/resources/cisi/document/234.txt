  The essentially logistical problem of making library books physicallyavailable when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  Thisbook is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As suchit has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality ofsolutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoreticalanalysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understandingof the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  Thefact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that theinsight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead toa better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved libraryservices.
