   The distribution of references in a collection of pertinent source documentscan be described and predicted by the relation F(x) = ln(1 + bx)/ln(1 + b) wherethe parameter b is related to the subject field and the completeness of thecollection.. The model is used to predict the reference yield of abstractingjournals in a search for thermophysical property data.. It is used also to explain differences among various literature studies of the past in terms ofdifferences in subject and comprehensiveness of search.. The model is derived from S.C. Bradford's 'law of scattering' and is called the Bradford Distribution..
