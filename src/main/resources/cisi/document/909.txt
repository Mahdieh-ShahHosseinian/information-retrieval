  It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-cityservice that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal linkbetween community residents and social agencies.  The major question iswhether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdenedsocial service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library inthis role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation forimpartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue andis not committed to any particular action program, community service orclientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize,update and disseminate information.
