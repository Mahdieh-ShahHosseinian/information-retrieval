  Responding to the heightened interest in the possibilities of networks,and reflecting its own continuing interest in improving the use of newtechnologies in research and education, the National Science Foundationin 1972 announced the mounting of "an expanded research program . . .to explore . . . the resource-sharing potential of a national network insupport of research and education."  The NSF was well aware of the obstaclesand uncertainties, and it knew that although shareable resources andpockets of relevant information and experience existed, many of the peoplewho should be involved in planning were not currently informed or discussingthe possibilities with one another.
