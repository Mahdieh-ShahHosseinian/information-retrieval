  The application of computer technology to library andnetwork processes and services is not an end in itself, butrather a means of narrowing the gap between the demandfor library services and the ability of libraries to providethose services.  Libraries have assumed the active role ofserving the informational, educational and recreational needsof the population.  The size of that population grows constantly,its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage ofleisure time is increasing.  The application of computer technology to libraries,especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records inthe performance of library functions, is a complex processand demands the highest level of talent of both the libraryand computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot beaccomplished by either profession alone; rather, the designof a library system is a team effort between librarians,computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even alimited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is tofit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallestproject will affect nearly all operations of the library.  Forthese reasons it is necessary that all library staff have atleast a general overview of what library automation is allabout.
