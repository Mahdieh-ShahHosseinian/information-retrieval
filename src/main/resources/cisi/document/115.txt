   This research study is concerned with the use of the last circulation date as a statistic to help describe library user circulation requirements.. Some decision rules were developed to use this parameter as an aid in determining thenumber of copies of books to be held in the library and as an aid in theweeding of books from the library's holdings.. The effect of these decisionrules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations are described.. The method of data collection is described in detail and is applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems.. Cumulative distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries and a public library were prepared and have been plotted for both circulation data and stack holding data.. This same data has also been plotted by subdividedsubject category.. Circulation operating characteristics were prepared for allthree libraries..
