  Copyright protection became necessary with the inventionof the printing press and had its early beginnings in theBritish censorship laws.  The fortunes of the law of copyrighthave always been closely connected with freedom of expression,on the one hand, and with technological improvementsin means of dissemination, on the other.  Successive ages havedrawn different balances among the interest of the writer inthe control and exploitation of his intellectual property, therelated interest of the publisher, and the competing interest ofsociety in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas.  It is thisstriking of balances in the law of copyright in the past, atpresent, and for the future, which constitutes the centraltheme of the James Carpentier Lectures delivered byProfessor Benjamin Kaplan at the Columbia University Schoolof Law in March, 1966.
