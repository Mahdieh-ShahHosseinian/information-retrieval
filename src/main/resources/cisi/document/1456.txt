  One of the most significant aspects of the evolution oflibrarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence of the library schools as a potent factor in shaping newphilosophies and new attitudes in the library profession.  Theintention of the present work is to examine some of theimplications of this rapid growth in the number of libraryschools, noting current trends and possible changes in thefuture.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed,and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo-American library education, while at the same time examiningother major patterns of professional education for librarianswhich exist in the world, and comparing these with theapproach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt hasbeen made to trace the influences which the British andAmerica systems of library education have had, particularlyin the developing countries.
