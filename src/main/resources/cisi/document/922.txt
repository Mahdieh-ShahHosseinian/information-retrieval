        Social structures have changed more quickly during    the last one hundred years than during any other equivalent    period in history.  With these changes have come alternations    in the role of institutions of higher education.  During    the Centennial Year we shall try to measure the need and    nature of further change and to evolve ideas that may    influence its direction.    In keeping with this idea, the Graduate School of Library Scienceof the University of Illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitiousfor holding an International Conference on Education for Librarianship.The profession as a whole and library education in particular are stillquite young, but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionarychanges.  Demands have been made on the world's libraries, and in turn onthe schools' training personnel for these libraries, almost too rapidlyfor them to satisfy.  It seemed logical for library education, therefore,"to measure the need and nature of future change and to evolve ideas thatmay influence its direction."
