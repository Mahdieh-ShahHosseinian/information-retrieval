  Although there is an extensive and enjoyable literature on the subjectof rare books, most of it is concerned with bibliography or bookcollecting, and relatively little on the librarianship of rare booksis available.  This book is an attempt to consider some of the problemsof custodianship and exploitation of special collections in libraries;problems sufficiently different, I believe, to make the concept of rarebook librarianship a valid one.  It is based distantly upon lecture notesfor a course on this subject which was offered to postgraduate studentsat Loughborough University.
