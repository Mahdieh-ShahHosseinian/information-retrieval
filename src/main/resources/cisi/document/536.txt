  This book is designed primarily for use as a first-year graduate text ininformation theory, suitable for both engineers and mathematicians.  It isassumed that the reader has some understanding of freshman calculus andelementary probability, and in the later chapters some introductory randomprocess theory.  Unfortunately there is one more requirement that is harderto meet.  The reader must have a reasonable level of mathematical maturityand capability for abstract thought.  The major results of the theory arequite subtle and abstract and must sometimes be arrived at by what appears tobe rather devious routes.  Fortunately, recent simplifications in the theoryhave made the major results more accessible than in the past.
