  This book is about the business firm and the way it makes economic decisions.  We propose to make detailed observationsof the procedures by which firms make decisions andto use these observations as a basis for a theory of decisionmaking within business organizations.  Our articles of faithare simple.  We believe that, in order to understand contemporaryeconomic decision making, we need to supplementthe study of market factors with an examination ofthe internal operation of the firm - to study the effects oforganizational structure and conventional practice on thedevelopment of goals, the formation of expectations, andthe execution of choices.
