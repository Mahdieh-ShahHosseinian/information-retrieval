   Eighty-two documents and 30 questions, in documentation and related areas, was compared to find answer-providing documents (documents from which answers to questions can be inferred).. Two judges (documentation experts) made comparisons independently.. They discussed their disagreements, attempting toresolve them.. In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate whatanswer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussiondepended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providingor reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage'smeaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness).. This seemsbetter than treating relevance judgements as subjective and not open to rational discussion..
