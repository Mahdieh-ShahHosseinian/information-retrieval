  We speak of book publishing as an industry and as a profession.Both designations are certainly appropriate.  Book publishing isa business conducted, for the most part, for profit.  But itspractitioners - at least those who do it honor - havemotivations that transcend their profit interest.  They knowthat books are no mere commodity, no mere items for consumption thatleave their readers much as they find them.  Books, like other vehicles ofinformation and sources of entertainment can change, influence, elevate,demean, exalt, or depress those who expose themselves to them.	Whatbooks are and can be depends heavily on the judgement, integrity, taste,and acumen of those who select and produce them - their publishers.
