  This paper defines the relationship between linguisticsand information science in terms of a common interestin natural language.  The notion of automated processingof natural language - i.e., machine simulation ofthe language processing activities of a human - providesnovel possibilities for interaction between linguists,who have a theoretical interest in such activities,and information scientists, who have more practicalgoals, e.g. simulating the language processing activitiesof an indexer with a machine.  The concept of a natural language information systemis introduced as a framework for reviewing automatedlanguage processing effort by computationallinguists and information scientists.  In terms of thisframework, the former have concentrated on automatingthe operations of the component for content analysisand representation, while the latter have emphasizedthe data management component.  The complementarynature of these developments allows thepostulation of an integrated approach to automatedlanguage processing.  This approach, which is outlinedin the final sections of the paper, incorporates currentnotions in linguistic theory and information science, aswell as design features of recent computational linguisticmodels.
