  The purpose of this paper is to present up-to-datematerial to indicate some of the changes that have takenplace during and since World War II.  For purposes ofcomparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard isrepresented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  Theresults of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4.The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  Abouthalf of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to paperspublished in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects thepresent highly vigorous state of chemical investigationand its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another strikingfact is that in the Journal of the American ChemicalSociety, 39.5% of the citations are to previous workpublished in the journal itself.  In Industrial andEngineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citationsis 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the factthat writers who habitually publish in a particularjournal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seemsto reflect to a greater degree the dominance of thesejournals in their respective fields.  More than 38%of the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistryare to various American Chemical Society publications.In the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than45% of the citations are to Society publications.
