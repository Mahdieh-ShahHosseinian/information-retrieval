  This report deals with a complementary theme: the public for which thepublic library service is provided.  It does this in two ways - by givinginformation about the nature of that public, as it is at present made up,and by reporting what people say about public libraries, not only thosewho are members, but also those who used to belong and those who neverhave.  Its closest relatives in British writing on this subject are, therefore,Mass Observation's now dated Reading in Tottenham (1947) and theSociety of Young Publishers' Survey Books in London, 1959.  It is morecomprehensive in scope and more detailed in its analysis that the Tottenhamsurvey, while it goes in some depth into issues that necessarily played only a small part in Books in London.
