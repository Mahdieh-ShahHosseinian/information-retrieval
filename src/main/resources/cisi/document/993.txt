   In an effort to develop a simple method for librarians to employ to measureand evaluate author catalogue use, the Library Management Research Unit testeda survey design in four varying libraries.. The reader was asked to note detailsof items not found in the catalogue, the source of the reference, and his status.. The items were then checked by library staff to discover the cause of"failure".. Library staff interviewed samples of catalogue users to determine the overall rate of "failure", the cooperation (with "Catalogue Query Slips") rate, and the action readers proposed to take in order to obtain the item(s) notfound in the catalogue..
