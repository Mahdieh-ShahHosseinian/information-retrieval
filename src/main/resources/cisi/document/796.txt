  Classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that careis needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application, suchas information retrieval.  Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevantto a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we thinkwe want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to findmore material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  Thisimplies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the wholeoperation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assumingthat we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to berelevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition ofparticular classes and their relations.  The fact that the instrument we use toassist this operation may display quasi-classificatory features (e.g.,alphabetical sequence) or may consist largely of our own brain box and memorystore should not hide this otherwise obvious fact.
