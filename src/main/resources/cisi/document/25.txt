   As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the sciencestudying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particularsystem of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelmingmajority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraicstructures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The firstgeneral theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitraryoperations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basicprinciples of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Suchsets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory madeabundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility ofmaking fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras butalso the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory wasdiscovered by the author in 1936.  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that thetheory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimatelyrelated despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  Andit is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systemsdealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations andrelations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is thelanguage of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory canbe considered to border on logic and algebra.
