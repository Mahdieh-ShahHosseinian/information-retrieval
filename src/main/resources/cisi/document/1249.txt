  The fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to genuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship tothe goals of librarianship.  Viewed in this way, and perhaps asantidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technicalmatters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with therituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectualinquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, thehabits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship andthe scholar.  Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context whichclearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realisticallynot only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joyswhich derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fitfor the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing moreto its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creativecapacity, who have not before held this perspective of research.
