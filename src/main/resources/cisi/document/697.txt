   The computer program for the generation of Weswesser Line Notation (WLN) hasbeen extended to include polyfused rings, methyl contraction rules, chain of two ring systems, some perifused rings, some chelates, and some metallocences..Salts and ions are also handled, but in a different manner than what is normallyfound.. Multipliers are not used by the program.. The normal input for the WLNgeneration is an easy input program using a Rand Tablet; however, teletype and connection table input can also be used in most cases..
