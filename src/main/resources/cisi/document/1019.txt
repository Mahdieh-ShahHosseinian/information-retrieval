  The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries,apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposedby the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, whichin university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was notconsidered to be of comparable importance with the major department --the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions wouldbe concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers orofficial documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largelyautonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staffwere mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and inanswering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections,especially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with thegeneral bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-dayreference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to becomeexpert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any partin the activities of another.. Divisions between the various kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library'sorganization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that thisis a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach.Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freezethe administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject fieldoften undertook research in the subject outside the library and mightoccasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of hisfield, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connectionwith his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer,orientalist or linguist.   The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a completere-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyondthe bounds of the old departments.
