  A good deal is now known about the use made by students of universitylibraries, notably from the surveys carried out by Leeds UniversityLibrary in 1957 and 1960.  Statistics of use, however, will not by themselvesindicate how good a library is, whether as a bookstock, a building, oran administrative department.  How adequate is the bookstock?  How fullyis it being exploited?  How important are physical and personal elements?These are questions librarians are continually asking themselves, but theyare also questions readers could be asked directly or indirectly.
