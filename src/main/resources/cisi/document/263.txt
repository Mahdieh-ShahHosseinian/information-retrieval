  The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified cataloguesrepresent three successive stages in the order of evolutionof the internal form of the Library Catalogue.  The classifiedform being the latest to evolve, the literature relatingto it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in theform of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  Whilethe number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairlylarge and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is alsorespectable, there appear to be few systematic and completecodes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue.Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-fiveyears of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocalinfluence gained by its being taught to students of libraryscience during the last twenty years.  While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples givenare constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules ofthis Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme fortheir applicability.  They are all of general application,irrespective of the scheme of classification in use.
