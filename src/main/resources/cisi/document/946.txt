    The combination of computers and communications technologyis a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S.    And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adaptingthe new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidlyexpanding telecommunications networks to serve their need todisseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in moreeffective ways.    It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that thelibrary's function is to parcel out information, and thatinformation can be forwarded electronically as easily as it canbe mailed.    In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyoneis hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts,state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includesXerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial effortsare concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- inparticular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio collegeLibrary Center, for example, provides its customers with entriesfor their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first andmost extensive of the networks, its approach is being closelycopied by the others.
