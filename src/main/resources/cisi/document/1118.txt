   Sets are considered on which a symmetric and reflexive relation, calledtolerance (similarity) is defined..   The structure of such sets is explored..    A classificatory theorem is proved stating an isomorphism of embedding ofsuch sets in a model space (R)..   The properties of particular sets' for which the similarity relation has been defined are investigated..
