  During the past three hundred years the journal article has becomethe main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication.Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility becausethey have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton,1971).  Who published what and where therefore becomes a central question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particularscientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number ofinvestigations concerning the career of such publications.  Thiscareer, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages.1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulatesit to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informalmeetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971).2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journalsfor publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the publishedarticle or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  Thepractice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in whichscholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline.
