  In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangementof entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship noeffort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement ofvolumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except forthat small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless.  The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users asindividual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potentialfor enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities ofwhich classical librarianship has deprived them since their days asone-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the onlycontribution computerization will make to libraries.  Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish newobjectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenonthat is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small speciallibraries already do, all libraries must participate in the culturalactivities of the individuals in their communities rather thanmerely make available a torpid "service." Libraries must look forward tosupplying information to a user when and where he needs it - anobjective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.
