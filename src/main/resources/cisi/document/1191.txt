  The establishment of the National Lending Library for Scienceand Technology (NLL) has been one of the most significant eventsin British librarianship in the twentieth century.  This book attemptsto trace the development of the library up to its merger into theimpending British Library, and to describe the philosophies whichshaped its policies and services.  I hope that the book will be ofvalue to British and overseas librarians as a case study of thedevelopment of a national library, and also to students of librarianshipand information work in that it may help them to appreciate the contextin which the library has evolved and in which it now operates.
