   In April 1970, the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Engineering Index, Inc. began a five-partstudy to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage intheir printed publications and computer-readable services.. This study was designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policiesand practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to theiruser communities..   This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of theservices, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the studywill determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles withinthe journals..
