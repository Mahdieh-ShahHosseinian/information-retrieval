  We can only guess what historians of the future will say about the condition ofpresent-day sociology.  But it seemssafe to anticipate one of their observations.When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history - as they well might, for this clanof historians promises to go on forever -they will doubtless find it strange that sofew sociologists (and historians) of thetwentieth century could bring themselves,in their work, to treat science as one of thegreat social institutions of the time.  Theywill observe that long after the sociology ofscience became an identifiable field ofinquiry, it remained little cultivated in aworld where science loomed large enough topresent mankind with the choice of destructionor survival.  They may even suggestthat somewhere in the process by which socialscientists take note of the world as it isand as it once was, a sense of values appearsto have become badly scrambled.
