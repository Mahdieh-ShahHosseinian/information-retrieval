  During the last two decades academic libraries, inparallel with their parent institutions, experienced thegreatest period of growth and affluence that they haveever known.  The watchword was "more" - more money,more books and journals, more staff, more space, andmore technology.  Many new research libraries werecreated, and those that already existed experiencedunprecedented growth.  Although libraries got more ofeverything during those years, they still could not keep pacewith the growth of new fields of research, new doctoralprograms, and the increasing production of books andjournals.  Two decades of affluence not only failed to helpsolve the many problems that were brought on byexponential growth - they exacerbated them.
