        The two studies presented here represent effortsto measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusivefashion:  that is, to apply certain tests generallysimilar to portions of the normal workload without drawingattention to the fact that a test is being carried out.  Thetwo projects were rather different as to purpose, method,and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance).Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time,arose partly from his experience in a county library.  Hiscuriousity about the real result of the reference activities(as different from merely counting the questions answered)led him to ask, "Is there substantial difference between theclaims made by librarians for reference work and the actualresult as observed in a number of different situations byindividuals posing as clients?"  The study which followedfrom this question was, then, exploratory and necessarilyless rigidly controlled than was the second study of thispair.
