  The objectives of the Sub-Committee in starting their enquiries werebasically three-fold     1) To gather a reasonable collection of statistics relating to the general        practice of classification in this country.     2) To gather information on th actual use of the Dewey Decimal        Classification in this country.     3) To provide a basis for the recommendations which are provided        periodically for the Dewey Editorial Policy Committee from the        Library Association Library Research Committee's Sub-Committee on        Dewey Decimal Classification Revision.To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all typesthroughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librariansto ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  Theresult of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority completed correctly.  The actual figures of type and size of library aregiven in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omittedand a significant proportion of the larger libraries returned the questionnaire.
