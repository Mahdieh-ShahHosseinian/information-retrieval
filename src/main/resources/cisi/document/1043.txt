  In this book we give a mathematical account of some of the methods of datasimplification which are involved in or suggested by the practice of biologicaltaxonomy.  The computable methods derived are offered as potentially usefultools for taxonomists, rather than as substitutes for their activities.  Superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use ofclassificatory systems:  biological taxonomy, ecology, psychology, linguistics,archaeology, sociology, etc.  But more detailed examination shows that thekinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are baseddiffer widely from science to science.  Whilst we recognize that some of themethods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are morewidely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biologicaltaxonomy.  The emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematicalproperties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions underwhich their application is valid, so that anyone who wishes to apply themethods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations, and of the linesalong which they may profitably be developed and modified.
