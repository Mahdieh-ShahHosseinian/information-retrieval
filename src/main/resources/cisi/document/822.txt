  The literature of the last few decades reflects a steadily increasingconcern with quantitative assessment of libraries and their services.  Thisconcern is both the result of, and a reaction to, growing pressures fromwithin and without the library profession to adopt the tools of themanagement sciences.  The pressures are generated by many factors includingthe success of these tools in other fields and their adoption by theorganizations supporting libraries, the increasingly explicit characterof competition for funds at all levels, and the complexity and criticalnature of decisions on the host of new options being created by technologyand by formalization of library networks.
