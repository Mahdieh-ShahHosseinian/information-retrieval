  The development of a current awareness system in The Dow Chemical Company has resulted in four established services, one based on internal information andthe other three on Chemical Abstracts.  In addition several other services are now being tried or considered.  The operation of such a service is expensive, but the willingness of the user to pay for it and responses to a survey indicatethat it is a useful and worthwhile tool to the scientist and engineer.  Theuse of such services also has a significant effect on other establishedinformation services.
