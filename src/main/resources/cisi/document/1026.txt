  This study was commissioned by the Committee on Linguistics inDocumentation of the Federation Internationale de Documentation (FID).It is concerned with the linguistic aspects of information science, andin particular with the linguistic components of document analysis,description, and retrieval.  We have attempted to relate linguisticsand information science by considering the theories and techniqueslinguistics has to offer, and how far these have been, or could be, exploited by information scientists.  We have examined these questionswithin the context of automated language processing and automated documentation.  The use of computers for linguistic operations presentsspecial challenges as well as interesting possibilities, and we havechosen to approach the field from this particular point of view.
