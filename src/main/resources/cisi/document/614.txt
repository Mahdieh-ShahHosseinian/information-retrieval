   The purpose of this investigation was to reveal the use of patterns of thephysics journals in the M.I.T. Science Library.. The findings are based uponan analysis of actual use data recorded from all volumes and issues left bylibrary users on study tables and on trucks in the photocopy area fromMarch 15 to June 31, 1971.. The Science Library contains some 220 physicsjournals.. The study reveals that only 138 journals (62.7%) were used evenonce during the 3 1/2-month interval.. A core of 49 journals supplies 90%of use, and these items would cost 51.1% of the total single subscriptioncosts of the 138 used titles:  52.3% of use occurs in journal volumes lessthan 6 years old.. English is the most used language of physics journals andthe English journals account for 95.3% of use.. American journals, 57.2% ofwhich are published by the American Institute of Physics, supply 59.4% of thetotal use..
