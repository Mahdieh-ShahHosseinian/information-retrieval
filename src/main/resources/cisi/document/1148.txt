  Among the avenues explored were the following: the attractions thefield holds for those now in it and those who might be drawn to it; thepersonality of those in the occupation and in its various subfields andwork roles; the characteristics and perspectives of the institutionaladministrators; supply and demand facets of the manpower problem;organizational relationships in libraries and information centers;library education as a professionalizing and socializing force; and theimplications of network development for manpower planning.  Central to thestudy rationale was the notion that librarianship should be viewed not asa static institution committed solely to traditional objectives, but as onewith the capacity to be responsive to changing environmental requirements.It was hoped that from the intelligence gathered from these inquiriescertain of the significant dimensions of the field's manpower concernswould be illuminated and proposals to influence future developmentwould be drawn.  Thus, while the investigations were in the nature ofmore basic research, their ends were committedly pragmatic.
