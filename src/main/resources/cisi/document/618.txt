   A series of models of the interrelationship of scientific journalshas been developed from the cross citing amongst 275 journals inmathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology..    The data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derivedfrom the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal byjournal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index..A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristicsof the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clearboundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinaryjournals as cross field information links..The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderlymanner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry -->biochemistry --> biology.. Within disciplines the journals form fullytransitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..
