  The present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraiclinguistics being pursued at Charles University, Prague.  It is based mainlyon P. Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at asystematic formulation of the conception of generative description that hasgradually been elaborated by our research group.  We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in adefinitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on anarticulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps beinteresting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics.This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existingform of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take themore recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to theirscope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses arecommented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present acomplete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpartto the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply triedto formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for thedevelopment of a new alternative.
