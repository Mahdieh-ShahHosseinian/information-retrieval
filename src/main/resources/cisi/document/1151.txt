  This book presupposes a knowledge of book cataloguing and basic cataloguingprinciples.  The Dewey decimal classification 9th abridged edition, Sears list of subject headings 9th edition, and A list of Canadian subject headings together with a form of simplified cataloguing found in many school librarieshave been used on the sample cards.  It must be emphasized that the subjectanalysis systems chosen by a particular library for its print collection shouldbe used for all media.  Because of its school library orientation, this bookdistinguishes between essential and optional elements on the catalogue card.Libraries which require detailed cataloguing will consistently list these options, and may wish to augment the description of materials in the collation and in thenotes.  Items necessary for a minimum description and for a complete descriptionwill be subject to further study prior to the next edition of this work.
