   A taxonomy for modeling information systems is presented.. The taxonomyderives from the history of modern epistemology.. Epistemology is used as aprescriptive modeling basis because (1) the fundamental problems of epistemology are concerned with information, and (2), because the history ofepistemology identifies any archetypal ways that men have conceived ofinformation and of models..   It is shown how the different models of epistemology can be madescientifically operational through the use of a special kind of systemsanalysis..   Finally, the results of a preliminary experiment based on one of the modelsare presented in the form of prescriptive rules for the design of futureexperiments..
