  It is easiest of all to apply mechanization and automation to thetransmission, accumulation and search of information.  Automationcan also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  Inall of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices areanalysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role ofmachine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than tocompletely replace man.   The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for informationhave come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  Thesesystems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,the latter playing the most prominent part.
