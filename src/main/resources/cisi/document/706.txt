  There are many chemical retrieval systems whichprocess the first type of request efficiently.  Most of thesesystems are also capable of handling certain fragmentrequests; however, the fragments which can be processedare frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, inretrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, onlythose fragments which are explicit in the cipher arereadily detected.  To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that adetailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the queryand library structures.  A technique for making such detailedcomparisons is presented in this report.  This techniqueis novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking adrestarting required by other atom-by-atom matchingprocedures.  Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,some definitions are reviewed and a brief example ispresented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flowdiagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additionalexamples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm fora digital computer is discussed.  This report is a condensed version of the original, whichgives a generalization and comprehensive description ofthe algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.
