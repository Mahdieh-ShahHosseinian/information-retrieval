    The general systems theory, pioneered by von Bertalanffy,Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapoport and their collaborators, gives us atheoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientificinformation and philosophic meaning.  Extended into a general systemsphilosophy, this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical sceneas a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles: by ordering the formerlyrandom segments into a meaningful pattern.  If made good use of, thisinstrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticatedanswers through the cross-fertilization of contemporary science andphilosophy.    This, then is my credo; the conviction which led to the formulation of thepresent Introduction to "systems philosophy" over a period of three yearsof research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection.
