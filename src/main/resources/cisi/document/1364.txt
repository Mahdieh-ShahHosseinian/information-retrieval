  An application of location theory tothe question of centralized versusdecentralized library facilities for auniversity, with relevance for special libraries is presented.  Locating universitylibraries near classrooms, offices, anddormitories requires a larger budgetthan combining these libraries into a centralized facility.  Yet there is a costto the university community which does not appear in the university budget - a costin time, energy, and decreased use resultingfrom locating the library a longer distancefrom users.  The analysis provides modelsfor a single library, for two or more libraries,or for decentralized facilities.
