  Among the several kinds of change that appear to be in order in personnelmanagement in university libraries, some have been described, others havenot.  There has perhaps been a super-abundance of attention devoted, forexample, to the inadequate treatment of librarians within the university community as a whole, but little discussion has thus far appeared in print concerning their treatment within the library itself. This paper will attempt to define certain progressive changes that it is possible and probably desirable for the library to implement internally regardless of the university'swillingness to consider improving the librarian's lot in the larger community.
