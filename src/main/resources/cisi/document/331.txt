  This book is a slightly modified form of a report on computerizedlibrary catalogs prepared for the Office of Education of the United StatesDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare (Contract OEC-1-7-071182-5013).  It consists of seven chapters.  The first poses the problemsthat have been studied, introduces background material to facilitate anunderstanding of their significance, and presents our conclusions andgeneral recommendations.  The remaining chapters belong to one of twoparts, depending on whether their principle concern is the utility or thecost of computeerized library catalogs.  Because the problem of utility is themore speculative of the two, it has been placed in the second part.
