  Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as asubject for investigation.  Though we have now accumulated an adequate supplyof source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries,no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of Americanlibrarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants fromthe past, but we have yet to convert them into history.  The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of theliterature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication andnaivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts.  There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the development of American library services which could eventually be puttogether to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship.The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end.  Itundertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuingproblems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services inresearch libraries.
