  The Curriculum Committee of the Special InterestGroup/Education Information Science of ASIS ischarged with the responsibility for determining thescope and characteristics of information scienceprograms in the US and Canada in terms of Curriculumdevelopments and course offerings.  To fulfill this responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicitreliable information concerning courses being offered relatingto information storage and retrieval, informationscience and/or documentation.  The data requestedincluded course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses,textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with whichoffered, etc.  Responses were received from 45 schools, providinginformation about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Usingseveral methods of clustering the data, it was difficultto arrive at firm results, because of the diversity andscatter of the topics included in this field.  It wastherefore decided to hold a workshop of experts whichwould examine the validity of the questionnaire results.  This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arriveat consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburghon September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in thefield representing universities industry and governmentwere brought together to participate.  Consensus wasreached in identifying nine factors which contribute tothe curriculum in information science and seven courseswhich constitute the core for the Master's program.The topics to be included in each of these courses werealso isolated.
