  Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to theserious reader today:  those that are content oriented, designed toconvey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure,the way in which events are organized.  It is doubtful if an author has any control over which of these two types of books he writes,though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The sameapplies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on hisunstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmedwith data from many sources, it is easy to understand why peopleare apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even intheir own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awarenessof a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatednessleads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aidin intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which manmust cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this.
