  The general purpose of my part in this program discussion is to reportto you on the new program of centralized acquisitions and catalogingto be undertaken by the Library of Congress under authorizationgranted under Title IIC of the Higher Education Act of 1965.  By thisaction, the Congress took two most important steps to aid libraries ofhigher education in the United States: (1) it fully recognized for thefirst time, the importance of granting Federal aid and assistance towardsolving the problem of cataloging in this country; and (2) it gave theLibrary of Congress a clear mandate to provide new and unparalleledservices for the benefit of academic and research libraries of this country.
