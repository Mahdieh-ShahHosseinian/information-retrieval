   Interactive systems, in existence for nearly 15 years, are becomingincreasingly important, both for information retrieval and library supportoperations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and -if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost ofthe large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still-high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user-system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfacesare only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by theNational Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimentalretrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineeringthe right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls hereinclude overselling system capabilities and failure to take into accountthe social context around the user terminal.. The major national problemis to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providingnationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private databases that will be readily available during the next few years.. We donot need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential ofon-line systems, but we do need breakthroughs in organizing fortechnological change..
