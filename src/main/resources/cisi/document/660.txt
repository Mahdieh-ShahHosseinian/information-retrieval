   This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing andsearching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is takenas the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparativeconcept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called "Probabilistic Indexing," allows a computingmachine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inferenceand derive a number (called the "relevance number") for each document, whichis a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given requestranked according to their probable relevance..   The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional librarysystem the cross-referencing ("see" and "see also") is based solely onthe "semantical closeness" between index terms, statistical measures ofcloseness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, givenan arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machinecan elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevantdocuments that would not otherwise have been selected..   Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole libraryproblem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis ofwhich the library system makes a concatenated statistical inferencein order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documentswhich most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..
