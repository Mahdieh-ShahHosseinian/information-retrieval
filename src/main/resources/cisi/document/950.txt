  In spite of the great volume of material dealing withdepartmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared inlibrary periodicals and books on university and collegelibrary administration, there has been relatively little originalthought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment toprovide an adequate background for solution of problems whichhave their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literaturehas been either repetition of the old arguments for and againstthis type of library organization or statements of how this orthat institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except forcontemporary accounts of early American scholars describing theattempts to transplant the German seminar library to Americansoil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is noaccount of the conditions which brought about and for manyyears invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation oftrends in the history of departmental libraries over the lastthree-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplementto other information in the hands of surveyors and administratorswho are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, oramalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution.
