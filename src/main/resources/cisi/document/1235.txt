  This book was written as an introduction to the administrativerelationships between small and medium-sized public librariesand the cooperative library system.  In this book, the definitionof a cooperative system is as follows:  A cooperative library systemis the combining of the talents and the resources of a group ofindependent libraries, within a reasonable geographic radius, forthe purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources forthe benefit of the actual and potential users of all the memberlibraries.  The plan for the book originated with questions directedto a public library administrator and to a system director.  Themost pertinent of the repeated questions was, "How does systemmembership change local library administration?"  The sharpestquestion was, "Will the system ultimately take over local rights andresponsibilities?"
