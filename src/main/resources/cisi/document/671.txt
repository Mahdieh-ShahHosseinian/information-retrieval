  As part of the development of a computer-basedchemical information system at CAS, it has been necessaryto devise techniques for the registration of drawings ofchemical structures.  A major purpose of the CAS registrationprocess is to determine whether a particular structure hasalready been stored in the system.  The ability to makethis determination makes it possible to utilize a computerto assign to every chemical structure a unique identifyinglabel.  This identifying label, referred to as a registrynumber, is the thread that ties together all informationassociated with a particular compound throughout thedeveloping CAS computer system.  It is because of this association, made possible by the registration process, thatCAS will be able to provide multiple-file correlative searcheswith assurance that all information on file for a particularcompound has been located.
