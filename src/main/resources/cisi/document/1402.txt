  Few librarians and library educators who criticize research relatingto their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed duringthe last decade and a half.  The criticism usually relates to therecognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact-finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist inthe research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  Onecan add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours aweek on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time onoriginal research or the writing of proposals, which either are notadequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  Ifthe librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionallycriticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limitedinterest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work thereare no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusionsinto action.
