  Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; thosewho seem to know all about this thing called "OCLC" and who keep popping thatrounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence,and the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life oneacronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLChas something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress?  Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and wherethis national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow -is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.  InOhio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC isnot simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes,but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since bookswere unchained from the shelves.
