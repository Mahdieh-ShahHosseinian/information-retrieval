  Mechanical means for expediting library work have been consideredfor many years, as an examination of the early pages of LibraryJournals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin,the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained anarticle on the use of the "typewriting machine" in cataloging.  Telephoneshave long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusualitems, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books.  Nevertheless, when the term "machine methods" is used for librariestoday, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronicequipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to affordsuch equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but thelargest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library ofMedicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanicalmethods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.
