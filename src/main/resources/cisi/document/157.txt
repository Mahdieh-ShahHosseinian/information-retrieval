  Planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem whichhas to be solved - for example, an increasing number of people may have to behoused in the same area; or by a long-term idealistic vision; or by both(the idealist seeing the long-term implications of an immediate problem).  Inshort-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may besolved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to takemy housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without consideringthe possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-termplanning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced.
