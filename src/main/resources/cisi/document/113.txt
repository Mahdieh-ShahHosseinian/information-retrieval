The Problem of assessing the "quality" of scientificpublications has long been a major impediment toprogress in the sociology of science.  Most researchershave typically paid homage to the belief that quantity ofoutput is not the equivalent of quality and have then goneahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemedto be no practicable way to measure the quality of largenumbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers ofscientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable toolto measure the significance of individual scientists'contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed allbibliographic references appearing in an increasingly largenumber of journals.  The number of citations anindividual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicatorof the relative scientific significance or "quality" of thatindividual's publications.
