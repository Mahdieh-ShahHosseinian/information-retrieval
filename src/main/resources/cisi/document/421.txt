   An automatic system is being developed to disseminate information to the various sections of any industrial, scientific or government organization.. This intelligence system will utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profilesfor each of the "action points" in an organization.. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by aword pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.. This papershows the flexibility of such a system in identifying known information, infinding who needs to know it and in disseminating it efficiently either in abstract form or as a complete document..
