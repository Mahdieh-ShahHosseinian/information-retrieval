   The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms fortext analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesauruslookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches oflarge collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base forcontent analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as completetexts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requestsare discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their properdesign are considered in light of these results..
