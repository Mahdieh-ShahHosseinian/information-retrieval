   A method is developed for optimally shelving inventory items by size, withparticular reference to large library collections..  The area presented by n+1distinct shelf heights is minimized for any collection that can be characterized by an item-height distribution.. When item-height is continuous,the necessary conditions for the extremum are recursive in the optimal shelfheights, and the solution reduces to a simple computational search.. For certain distribution functions, as demonstrated in the example, an additionalrecursive relation between the solutions for different n further simplified the computation considerable.. Geometrical representations of both the model and the solution method are presented.. The maximum increase in storage capacity can be expressed generally as a simple function of the mean and the maximumitem-height..
