   The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed bysubjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. Thisprevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search,particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him consciousof the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. Hewill also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods neededfor operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the methods sufficient for his personal file..   The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character offundamental notions such as "information" and "order".. This gives him a betterunderstanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently,even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to make such operations more "objective" and formal.. Such a better mutualunderstanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of scientific communication..
