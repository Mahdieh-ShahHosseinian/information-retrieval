   An evaluation of the performance of Index Medicus and MEDLARS in the fieldof ophthalmology is presented, using data generated by a separate study..MEDLARS performance figures gave a screened precision ratio of 54% and a recallratio of 42%.. Over the same set of questions Index Medicus had a screened precision ratio of 53% and a recall ratio of 46%.. Results for Index Medicus alone over a large set of questions gave a 73% screened precision ratio and a 47% recall ratio.. A random sample of MEDLARS and Index Medicus precision and recall failures showed that most of the Index Medicus recall failures resultedfrom manual searcher omission.. The major causes of Medlars precision failures were inadequate indexing terminalogy to express concepts and attempts atproviding too exhaustive a search..
