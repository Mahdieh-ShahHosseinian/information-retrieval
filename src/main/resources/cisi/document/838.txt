  Development in university libraries in recent years in reader services,instruction in library use and subject specialization go only a small wayto meeting the problems created by the "information explosion."  Reasonswhy more dynamic and personal information services for scientists andsocial scientists should be developed include the limitations in researchers'present use of libraries and information, the preference of users for informalchannels of communication, increasing pressures on the time of universityteachers, and problems associated with computer retrieval systems.  Specialistposts of information officer should be created as part of the library services,but with functions distinct from those of the librarian; difficulties thatmay arise with their location and operation are discussed.  The cost ofinformation services in depth is heavy, but it may be possible to developthem within the existing budget by a reallocation of funds and staff duties.
