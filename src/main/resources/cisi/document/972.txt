  In the earliest item (1905) in the bibliography here presented, Fletcherchallenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelminglypredominant type of catalog in libraries.  He questions its advocates' claimthat it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such asthe one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalogcan more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subjectfields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography(Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by morethan thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subjectof the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably somedivisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, thegreatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of theliterature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the yearin which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.
