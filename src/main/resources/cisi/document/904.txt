    Since the advent of periodical literature in the seventeenthcentury well over ten thousand journals have been published inthe field of bio-medicine.  Many of these have ceased publication;others are only of local interest.  Still, approximately two thousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currentlyreleased.  As research and discovery are recorded in the journalliterature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is itssubscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomesa major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth ofexperimental data available to their readers.  When funds arelimited, the selection of a periodical collection that will bestserve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramountimportance.  A plan of highly selective purchasing must be adoptedto prevent the improper use of funds.  Actual needs of the librarymust be at hand to carry out such a plan.
