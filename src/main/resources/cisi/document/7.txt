This book attempts to present representative examples of successfularchitectural solutions to the important problems librarians andarchitects face in planning new college and university librarybuildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It doesnot attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done byEllsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examplesof unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes,and in these cases the libraries will not be identified.
