  This book does not purport to provide all the answers to the problem (such aclaim would be rightly suspect) but to collect together problems and experiencespertaining to the technique.  Though three of the case studies in Chapter 8 arefrom outside the United Kingdom, there is an inevitable bias towards Britishexperience and English-language thesauri.  It is hoped that people outsidethis country will find the book useful, but there is little mention of, forexample, the language problem.  The way in which compound terms are treatedclearly depends on whether one is indexing in German, French or English, andeach language exhibits a different morphology.
