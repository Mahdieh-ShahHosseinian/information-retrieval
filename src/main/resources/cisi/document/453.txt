    The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the supply of,and above all the demand for, scientific and technical information;its secondary objective is to make a long-term assessment ofqualitative and quantitative requirements for information specialists.In both instances, of course, future technical developments, as faras they can be foreseen, must be taken into account.
