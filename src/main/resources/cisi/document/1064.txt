                The plan of this book follows our definition of organizationsas social units that pursue specific goals which they are structured toserve, obviously under some social circumstances.  Therefore the book hasthree foci:  organizational goals; organizational structure; and organizationsand their social environment.  Considerably more space is devoted toorganizational structure than to the other topics, for two reasons:  First,more research has been conducted and more writings are available onorganizational structure than on organizational goals (Chapter 2) and environment.  Second, the major schools of organizational analysis have fixedtheir interests on structural aspects of the organization, and thus, we maybest evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizationalstructure.
