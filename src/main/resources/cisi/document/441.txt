  We apply a 200-year-old mathematical theorem to a 175-year-old historicalproblem, more to advance statistics than history.  Though problems of disputedauthorship are common in history, literature, and politics, scholars regard theirsolutions as minor advances.  For us the question of whether Hamilton orMadison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory anddemonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods.While we help solve this historical problem, our practical application of Bayes'theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of amethod being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics.  Furthermore,large practical applications have until now been few, and our work helps fillthat gap.
