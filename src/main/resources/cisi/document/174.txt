  The idea for Automated Language Processing was suggested in 1964 at atime when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval wereexpanding at System Development Corporation.  Many people in the companywere directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had intereststhat were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquaintingthem with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilationof relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on thetheory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures wouldbe a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake.Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entirerange of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole isconcerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact thatall but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either asemployees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDChas had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management wasenthusiastic in its support of the new project.
