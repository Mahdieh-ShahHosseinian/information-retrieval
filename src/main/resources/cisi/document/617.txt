   An on-line serials control system with particular emphasis on storage andmaintenance concepts is described.. The system, operational since January,1971, has evolved from a former batch card system and remains completelycompatible with it.. The system allows real-time display and updating ofall elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claimsoperations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplishedon a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is anIBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applicationsprograms, and IBM 2260 display units..   This article is the first of three.. The second is concerned with ananalysis of inverted file retrieval features and the third compares theoperation of the on-line with the batch system, comparable manual operations,and discusses costs..
