  My plan in this paper is to try to apply to the field of experimentalpsychology the analysis of the characteristics of science (and, moreparticularly, the structure of scientific revolutions) as conceptualized byT.S. Kuhn.  Kuhn has not been accepted without criticism, but that need notprevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion.  I assumethat the reader will be familiar with Kuhn's analysis,so that only a sketchysummary of his position is necessary.  I will then take a brief look at some ofthe history of psychology, with special emphasis upon the major tenets ofbehaviorism.  Finally, I will advance some evidence to suggest that we may wellbe living in an era of revolution within psychology (as well as without).
