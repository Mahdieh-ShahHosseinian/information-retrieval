   Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that theyignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the timebetween a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) theresearch expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocableinvestment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods..   The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique ofdynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgetswhen the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained orunconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice..   Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibittheir practical application are discussed..
