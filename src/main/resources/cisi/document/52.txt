   The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the much argued question of whether author indexing is "good".. Author indexing of285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author-supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the samedocument.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. Theaverage author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by anauthor should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general methoddeveloped for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of wide applicability..
