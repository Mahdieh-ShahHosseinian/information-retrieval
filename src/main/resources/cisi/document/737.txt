  This paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random fileorganization methods for handling two major applications - Transactionoriented systems and Information storage and retrieval systems.  It thenaddresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorilyresolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under activeinvestigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One iscalled the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old techniquecalled super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics relatedto file characteristics in this application are provided, but operationalcost and performance statistics are not yet available.
