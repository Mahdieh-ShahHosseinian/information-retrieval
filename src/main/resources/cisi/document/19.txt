  In trying to give an account of the statistical properties oflanguage, one is faced with the problem of having to find thecommon thread which would show the many and multifarious formsof language statistics - embodied in scattered papers writtenby linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each usinghis own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole:quantitative linguistics.  The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of languagestructure as against just conventional statistics.  To put thedifference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprisesthe methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., inEconomics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterisingparameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating languagestructure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts andmethods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's "Language aschoice and Chance", 1956, has now taken definite shape.  Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book,"Language as Choice and Chance", the foundation was laid for a trulysensible application of statistics to language by my interpretationof the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statisticaluniverse and sample.
