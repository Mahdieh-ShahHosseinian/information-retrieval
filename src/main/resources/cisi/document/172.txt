  As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development,Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some sixthousand leading American scientists in the application ofscience to warfare.  In this significant article he holds upan incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  Heurges that men of science should then turn to the massive taskof making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather thanthe powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists,microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction anddetection are new results, but not the end results, of modernscience.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properlydeveloped, will give man access to and command over the inheritedknowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instrumentsshould be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge fromtheir war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "TheAmerican Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationshipbetween thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor
