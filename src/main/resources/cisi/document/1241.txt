  This Institute was designed both to encourage the use ofquantitative measurement and to teach the techniques necessaryfor such use.  It was hoped that an emphasis on statisticalmeasurement would upgrade administrative and research skillsand thus contribute to more efficient and effective librarymanagement.  Studies of librarians' academic backgrounds have indicateda preponderance of humanities and social science majors inthe field.  Too often librarians have had only a few courses inmathematics, and some actually have a psychological antipathytoward numbers.  This anti-mathematics syndrome haskept librarians from taking proper advantage of quantitativemethods.
