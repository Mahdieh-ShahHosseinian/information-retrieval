  In a letter in New Scientist (vol. 19, p. 148) the rate of duplication of research among scientists was said to have beenestimated at about 10 per cent.  The firstsystematic attempt to assess the size of this problem, carried out by the AslibResearch Department, suggests the actual figure is more than double this, and the consequent cost to the nation to be measurable in millions of pounds.  We put questions to 647 scientists engaged in industrial, academic or government research, including chemists, physicists, biologists, psychologistsand mathematicians.  One question was: "Have you, during your current research,discovered in the literature information which you wish you had had at the beginning of your project?"  To this, 144 of them (22 per cent) replied thatthey had.  Many had made more than one such find, so that the total number of instances was 245.
