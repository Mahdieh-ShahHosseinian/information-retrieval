   It was our original intention to include the cost of book selection withthe cost of ordering, as part of the total acquisition process.  We alsoattempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few ofthe libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on directcost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statisticswere extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in thelibraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarianperforming most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedinglyhigh and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion.
