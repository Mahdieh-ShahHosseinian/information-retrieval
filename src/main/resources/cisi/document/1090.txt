  Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear ScienceAbstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; weused the generalized file-management system, Master Control,which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode.The inverted mode uses a table composed of the uniquevocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along withall record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  Forexample, an inverted table constructed on titles will have oneentry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plusthe record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  Forexample, an inverted table constructed on titles will have oneentry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plusthe record numbers in which each word was found.  (In MasterControl, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded oneither side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma,colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode thedata element is compared with the profile word, character bycharacter, which results in a prohibitively time-consumingprocess for large data bases.  We chose the inverted-table technique because of the largeamount of data to be searched.  Individual tables wereconstructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, andtitles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlledby the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.  We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions hadto be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of thequestions had actually been submitted by other members of thestaff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDIbasis.  The others were especially constructed by the authorsfor this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to beconsidered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained tothe subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered"false drops," regardless of the number of words matchedbetween the profile and the citation.
