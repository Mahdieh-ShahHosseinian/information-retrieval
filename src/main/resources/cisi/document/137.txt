  Information science meets behavioral science in the study of informationneeds and uses.  At first, the meeting of these fields was inconclusive.  Untilthe mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of informationneeds and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature hasgrown rapidly.  There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields.When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data onusers' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluatinginformation system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse thefull complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrievalprocesses, they offer fewer naive solutions to "the information problem."  This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue.Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Scienceneeds them both.
