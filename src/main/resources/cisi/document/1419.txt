        Any who have the arduous task of assisting a studentthrough that ultimate of academic exercises, the preparationand defense of a dissertation, are likely to define happinessas a good book written by an advisee.  This book is a causeof joy.  The author expended much more effort than is usuallythe case to gain even the smallest detail, because the subjectmatter is strangely intractable, hedged round with perplexitiesand not a few vested interests.  Letters and reports get lockedaway where they may not be seen except by the most persistentinvestigator and one who somehow meets criteria that no one elsecan claim.  In the end, the author deserves the praise and theadvisor is well rewarded with the inner satisfaction that comesfrom participation in an important investigation finished as aninfluential and well-written book.
