  My main reason for writing this book is to reassert the methodologicalpriority of the search for the laws of history in the science ofman.  There is an urgency associated with this rededication, whichgrows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planningof anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologistshave been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of internationaldevelopment programs.  A general theory of history is required if the expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other thanthe rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learnedjournals.  The publishing of more and more about less and less is an acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not leadto an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues.
