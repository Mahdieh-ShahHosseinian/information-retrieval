  In recent years, it has become recognized that a country'sdocumentation and library services, indispensable for all forms ofeconomic, social and cultural development, should be consideredas one co-ordinated information system and accordingly includedin any national development plans.  However, planning can only becarried out if the necessary statistical data and other informationare available.  Unesco therefore concluded a contract in 1968 withthe International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) for asurvey of standards for library services currently recommended forlibraries of all types in different countries.  The work was entrustedto F.N. Withers, a research fellow at the Polytechnic of NorthLondon School of Librarianship (United Kingdom).
