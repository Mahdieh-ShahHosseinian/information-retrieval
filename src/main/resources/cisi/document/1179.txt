   A notation for coding organic structures has been developed which providesfor very simple and rational rules of coding the common cyclic fragments..   The conventional unit used in coding regular structures is benzol ring, andthe skeleton of the regular condensed system is coded using a sequence of evenand odd integers.. The set of rules for coding regular systems might be used ascomponent of a universal notation for organic compounds.. The code offered bythe author is designed to cover an important and broad class of compounds withconjugate bonds and it can be used within the framework of a specialized computer-based information retrieval system in the capacity of both the input and the internal machine language..
