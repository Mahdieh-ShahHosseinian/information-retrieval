  This book is an introduction to the elements, methods, and problemsof interactive systems and is tutorial in tone.  It is intended for bothusers and designers of conversational systems: those who actually operatethem as well as those who design the overall systems in which they areused.  I would expect, primarily, to draw my readers from among thedesigners of information systems and such prospective users as teachers,writers, librarians, lawyers, design engineers, and professional managers.The book is a survey and is not intended as an exhaustive text.  Thereader wishing to pursue any topic in detail will have to seek further,but I have provided references to help him do so.
