    A state-of-the-art survey of automatic indexing systemsand experiments has been conducted by the Research InformationCenter and Advisory Service on Information Processing,Information Technology Division, Institute for AppliedTechnology, National Bureau of Standards.  Consideration is firstgiven to indexes compiled by or with the aid of machines,including citation indexes.  Automatic derivative indexing isexemplified by key-word-in-context (KWIC) and other word-in-context techniques.  Advantages, disadvantages, andpossibilities for modification and improvement are discussed.Experiments in automatic assignment indexing are summarized.Related research efforts in such areas as automatic classificationand categorization, computer use of thesauri, statisticalassociation techniques, and linguistic data processing aredescribed.  A major question is that of evaluation, particularlyin view of evidence of human inter-indexer inconsistency.  Itis concluded that indexes based on words extracted from textare practical for many purposes today, and that automaticassignment indexing and classification experiments show promisefor future progress.
