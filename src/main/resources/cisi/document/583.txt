  A librarian attempting to do a literature search currentlyfaces an eight-month gap in access to the literature ofhis field through Library Literature.  In April 1968,librarians made a rare examination of their own literatureand considered this gap and other information problemsin librarianship.  The Albany Conference on the BibliographicControl of Library Science Literature recommended theestablishment of a fast announcement service for libraryschools (1).  A monthly Keyword in Context (KWIC) indexserving the whole range of information-oriented professions was a specific proposal which was favored by one conferencegroup to meet the need for current information (2).
