  Perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientificinformation industry is that it is not just that special part of an informationindustry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content.  Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics.  My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategicconference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest andmost useful advances in our technologies have not come from the appliedresearch of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, butrather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity,and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised.I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be moreuseful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will tosolving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear,however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success,whatever solutions ultimately emerge.
