  This programmed text has been developed from work initially carried outunder a research project funded by the Office for Scientific and TechnicalInformation (now the British Library Research and DevelopmentDepartment).  The project, designed to investigate the applicability of thetechniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subjectindexing, was conducted at the School of Librarianship, the Polytechnicof North London in cooperation with the College of Librarianship Wales.The programmed instruction course, written during this project and usedby students at both Schools of Librarianship, forms the basis of theprogrammed text.  Most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practicalsubject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing andaim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages.  Ourintention, in the above-mentioned project, was to produce a course ofprogrammed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basicprinciples and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particularsystem.
