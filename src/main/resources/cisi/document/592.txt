  Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins'Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher whocomposed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics withthe aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, whichcontained absolutely no information on that subject.The technique used, we are told with a nudge ofsuperiority, was to read for metaphysics under theletter M, and for China under the letter C, and tocombine the information.  I feel that we may be performing just such a miracleof creative juxtaposition when we assume that ScientificInformation is just some special variety of informationthat contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate,pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose toothat Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to befull of scientific books, and that the best possibletechnical librarian would be somebody who had picked up alibrary qualification and combined it with the appropriatesort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used tosay, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemicalcompound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there ismore to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage and retrieval of information, and there is about scienceand technology something intrinsically different frommere scholarship.
