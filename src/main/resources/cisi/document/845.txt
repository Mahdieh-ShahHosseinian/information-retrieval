  Twenty years ago Jesse Shera suggested that there was a need for a moreanalytical study of bibliography which might help to bridge library andinformation services.  Little note was taken of this proposal at the timebut developments have since occurred and are here briefly reported.  It isargued that Shera's "macrobibliography" or "social epistemology" providesnot only a subject for theoretical study but that it will also be neededfor the rational design of library and information systems and networks ofthe near future.
