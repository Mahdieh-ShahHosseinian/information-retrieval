  The marriage between the University of Michigan Library andCommunity Systems Foundation seemed like a sensible step at thetime.  Too often, Library administration found it necessary to choosebetween alternate courses of action without having adequate information.In addition, overburdened department heads rarely found timeto alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on thelibrary and their departments, let alone time to make these changesin a systematic manner which considered the impact on otherdepartments and carefully weighed alternative solutions.  As aconsequence of this situation, the library administrators wereconsidering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves andthe department heads, so that alternate courses of action couldbe designed and properly evaluated.
