  This book presents the concept of the modern library as a comprehensiveresource center.  The philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified,and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook oraudiovisual materials - interchangeably defined as those materials that communicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli - are recommended,along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks.  Their organization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity forbasic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treatedin particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexibleenough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specificclientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbookmaterials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to-follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with establishedlibrary routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition,physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are includedto present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures.
