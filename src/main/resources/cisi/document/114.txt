  This book is intended to supply the background needed forparticipation in the analysis and design of information-handlingsystems and for understanding the literature in the field.I have tried to present a unified approach to the subjectand to the relation of information retrieval to otherdisciplines and an appreciation of the importance of thisinterdisciplinary relationship.  I hope that the scientistor computer programmer, newly interested in information-retrievalproblems, as well as the librarian, will find the book of value.
