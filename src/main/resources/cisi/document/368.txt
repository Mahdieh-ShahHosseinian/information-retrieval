  It is not a simple matter to describe this book.  Briefly, itattempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theorythat may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision-makers in the selection, financing, and/or use of computers.  Onlytheory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This meansthat the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outsidethe scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal,thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on thesmall (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross nationalproduct, consumer price index, unemployment).
