  There are two major purposes, in mind, for this gathering.  The first is themost general that can be proposed for any gathering: the simple advantage ofbringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at leasta small class of problems - especially when this problem has not previouslybenefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators.To further such thematic collaboration, the formal presentations have beenscheduled no more than three each day, with time left after each presentationfor (formal) discussion here in the conference room, and with as much time aspossible - given the number of presentations - left free for informal discussion.   The second purpose is one of even greater necessity, in my opinion, thoughone not so obvious as the first.  Over and above the hope for interchange ofwhat has already been thought out - in the form of personal contact, wherethe presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce theprinted word in its usual and ineffable way - it is my hope that we will allbe able (especially in our informal discussions) to penetrate beyond meresimilarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntacticrelationship.
