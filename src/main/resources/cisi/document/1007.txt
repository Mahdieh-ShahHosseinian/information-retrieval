        The measurement and evaluation of reference servicehas been more often discussed than attempted.  In fact, the literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized literature of review.        Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, andcataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with littleagreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending anintegral part of reference work because many reference librariansare responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of booksand libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  Thepreparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus "reference librarian" does, how can one readily determine theeffectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librariansmay have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of aproblem, but it is undeniably a big one.
