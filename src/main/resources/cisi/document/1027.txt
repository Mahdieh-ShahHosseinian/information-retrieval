  To permit a qualitative estimate of a college library's resources, theAdvisory Group on College Libraries of the Carnegie Corporation authorizedthe compilation of a list of not less that 8,000 nor more than 15,000 titleswhich might be regarded as a statement of the minimum or basic book collectionof a four-year liberal arts college.  The procedure on which the Advisory Group decided included (1) the selectionof a librarian under whose direction the compilation should be made, (2) thechecking and improvement of the original lists drawn up by this compiler by sucha homogeneous group as the faculty of a single college, and (3) the submissionof these revised recommendations to an able group of widely scattered collegeteachers for further revision.
