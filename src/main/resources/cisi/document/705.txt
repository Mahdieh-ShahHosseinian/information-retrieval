  Methods for retrieval of information on chemical compounds utilizing severalcomputer data bases have been compared to determine scope of data base coverage.Queries for a single chemical, N-ethyl-@-methyl-m-trifluoromethylphenethylamine(fenfluramine) and generic chemicals (2-pyrrolidinones) were submitted to theservices for searching through the recent literature.  Data bases employedincluded MEDLARS, Excerpta Medica, CA Condensates, CBAC, Ringdoc, CurrentAbstracts in Chemistry and Automatic New Structure Alert (ANSA).  Preparationof search questions is outlined and comparative results are reported indicatingthe yield from each data base.
