  The deadliest disease afflicting the library press is proliferation.  Thekindest and most conservative estimate I am able to bring myself to make isthat there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this countryas we can afford or are necessary. Perhaps the most constructive single thingthat could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in threepublishers of a library periodical to cease publication.  One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so muchpublic wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chiefadvocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print.  Insteadwe find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed procreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and technology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of littleconsequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organizationwithin the loose boundaries of our  profession, decides, virtually at themoment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of itsown - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its presence to the world at large.
