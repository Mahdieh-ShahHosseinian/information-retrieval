  A number of trips to the United States, to teach in library schools, haveinculcated in me a variety of views about the present state of Americanlibrary education.  They are personal opinions - no more - but they comefrom one who has seen much that he admires and who believes wholeheartedlythat the American spirit includes  a firm resolution to change whateveris inefficient or corrupt.  Otherwise, 1776 would have no meaning.  Theopinions do not stem directly from my experience in the five accreditedschools in which I have taught, but are strongly rooted in my generalobservation of library education practice and my discussions with members of the library profession.
