  The relative retrieval performances of the CA Integrated Subject File (CAISF),CA Condensates, and a Merged File created from these two data bases have beenmeasured.  Retrieval performance is reported in terms of recall and precisionvalues as well as costs.  The precision and recall retrieval failures - i.e.,irrelevant documents and missed documents - have been analyzed for each database and characterized according to the five major types of failures: index language, indexing, searching, clerical, and miscellaneous.  Over-all analysisof the performance suggests that an effective data base can be created byaugmenting the CA Condensates data base with Registry Numbers and somerepresentation of the CAISF General Subject concept headings, which resultsin a file approximately half the size of the corresponding CAISF data baseand is suitable for search using existing retrieval system software.
