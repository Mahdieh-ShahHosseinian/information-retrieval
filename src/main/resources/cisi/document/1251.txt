   This report describes the results of a study of a practical method of preparing Library of Congress card catalog data in machine form for (1)the automatic typesetting of cards and book catalogs, and (2) distribution to other libraries throughout the country for all foreseeable bibliographic andtypographic applications of such data, including preparation of local catalogs..   The first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on aperforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on thecard.. After the data is edited and corrected, it is processed by a computerto form (1) catalog card typesetting tapes, (2) the National Union Catalog,(3) Library of Congress Books, Subjects Catalog, magnetic tape catalog files,and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution..The procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear onLibrary of Congress cards, should studies find that the value of the dataexceeds the cost of recording it..   A demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce perforated tape records.. These record tapes were automatically converted to avariety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and bookcatalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards..
