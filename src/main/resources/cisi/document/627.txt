   It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenancerules and conventions are not theoretically based.. For this reason, thereare few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage andretrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authorsand readers is linear in nature ("one-way" communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updatedby both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauriviewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cyberneticprocess of communication ("both-way" communication).. The surveyindicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largelydone by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory ofthesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued thatsuch a theory, if developed, should at least account for the conceptsof meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, twotechniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updatingof a thesaurus..
