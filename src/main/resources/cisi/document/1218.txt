  This book is written primarily for college students who have no previousbackground in operations research and who intend careers as administrators,consultants, executives, or managers in business, nonprofit enterprises, orgovernment.  The broad topic coverage also should make the text helpful forstudents who seek careers as teachers and researchers as well as for practitioners who desire an up-to-date review of operations research.  Thebook can be used in half-year or full-year introductory courses for juniors,seniors, or graduates in business, economics, and engineering curricula.  The central goal of the book is to answer the question, "What are thefundamental ideas of operations research?"  The text does not presuppose anyadvanced training in business administration, industrial engineering,mathematics, statistics, probability theory, or economics.  Therefore, themain ideas do not rely on the reader's being expert in these areas.  Thetext does assume, however, that the reader is not entirely naive about suchsubjects.
