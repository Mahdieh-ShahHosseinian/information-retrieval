  The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value isappreciated.  For documentation and information retrieval ingeneral, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing andmachine selection are also available.  That classification is ofvalue in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistencyand subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selectiondesigners of such retrieval systems find the need to introduceclassificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demandfor the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangementand cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensivelycultivated fields of knowledge.  It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, thatthis guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depthclassification have been greatly developed during the past decade,and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than thetraditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.These developments have been reported mainly as research papersin a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarilydifficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.There is a need for a more simply written and more readilyavailable practical guide to the use of the newer techniques ofclassification.
