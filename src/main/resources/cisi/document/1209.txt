  When physicists wish to communicate their work by means of publication,several considerations are weighed before choosing the appropriate journal.There is the matter of audience; of the probable delay between acceptanceand publication; of article format (letter, review, standard research report).If the article is potentially controversial, the author may estimate its chances of being accepted by different journals. Considerations of national pride may sway the choice:  An author may submit a work to a journal in his own country rather than to one that has a greater circulation and impact but is published in a foreign country.
