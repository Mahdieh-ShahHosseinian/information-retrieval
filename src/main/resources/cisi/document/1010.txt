                Unmistakable signs are pointing the way towardthe creation sometime soon of a national information networkin the United States.  The concept of a national network impliesthe interconnection of existing information systems and librariesthrough communications.  Certainly one of the great strengths of thisnation is the great array of intellectual, scholarly, and researchresources to be found in its libraries and information centers.  Without integration and close cooperation, however, these resourceswill remain a series of separate, insulated institutions.  But ifmaximum communication can be established among them, this array canbe converted into a national resource of immense value to citizensthroughout the country.
