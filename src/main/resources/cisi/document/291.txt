  This article is directed toward the service in systems work.  Its purpose is to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can beused in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a pointof view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-makingand resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticatedtechniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however,will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made todiscuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming,simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any ofthe other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearlyunderstood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenalof the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, adelineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian.
