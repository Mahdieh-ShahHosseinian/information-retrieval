     As important for staff members' individual developmentas was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the mostsignificant attitude one acquired while working forGuy was engendered by his insistence that librarians mustbe interested in and knowledgeable about the content of thematerials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, hisrespect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing andreading were manifested in many ways, but most notably inhis admonition that, though we were primarily a researchlibrary, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation tocollect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  Itwas primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to beresponsible for these as well as for "general" books which crosseddisciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those bookswhich a faculty mostly concerned with research materials isapt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection,"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance withbooks through a reading of critical reviews and the booksthemselves."  This counsel is from The President, the Professor,and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--theneed to keep up with the world of books and publishing--wascontinually impressed upon us.
