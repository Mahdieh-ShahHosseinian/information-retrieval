  Increasingly, librarians have felt the need for more accurate costdata.  The prime reason for this need has been in the developmentand presentation of the budget which is the instrument used to determineand obtain the funds for the library's forthcoming fiscal period.Since libraries do not charge for the service they render their users,they must derive the funds necessary for their operations and growth fromsupporting bodies such as federal, state, or local governments, privateinstitutions, and industrial firms.
