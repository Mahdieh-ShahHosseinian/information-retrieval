   The findings are described of a study aimed at determining the prospects andmethods for improving the system of current bibliographic information..  Theanalysis has shown that the existing criteria for evaluation of specialbibliographies (scope, coverage, arrangement, speed of announcement, etc.) areinadequate for an unbiased characterization of their exhaustivity and subjectcontents..  This hampers a correct choice of the sources of secondary information and leads to duplication, parallelisms and loss of information..Judgements of the leading Soviet and foreign bibliographers relating to theproblems under consideration are reviewed, which are all essentially in favor of a reconstruction of the publishing processes, issuing of scientific publications on a world scale, and algorithmization of the informationprocesses..  It is suggested that the first objective of research should bea method of comparative evaluation of periodicals..
