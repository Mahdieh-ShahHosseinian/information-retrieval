  A survey of the information use patterns and communication practicesof academic physicists in the  greater Boston area reveals that academic physicists rely heavily on formal and informal sources of information.  Theiruse of formal publications concentrates on a small number of journal titles.  Time and location factors play an important rolein their information seeking and gathering. A considerable number of thephysicists surveyed do not seek librarians' help when searching forinformation in the library.  Although libraries have been considered largely asstorehouses of materials and librarians organizers of these materials, more active roles for librarians are possible.
