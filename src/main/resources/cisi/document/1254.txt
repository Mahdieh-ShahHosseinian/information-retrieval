    This volume continues the account of the Aslib-Cranfield project as givenin the "Final Report of the First Stage of an Investigation into the ComparativeEfficiency of Indexing Systems".  The major portion of the two years spent onthis present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerableamount of data which was obtained from the main test programme.  A difficultyin this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likelyto yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonablelimits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, andeven so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has beenplaced on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this isconsidered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and hasnot, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance,but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval ofnon-relevant references.  This analysis has not been attempted within thepresent work, but will be one of the matters to be investigated in the continuation of the project.
