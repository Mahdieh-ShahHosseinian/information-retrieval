  Before starting to trace the development of PRECIS to itstheoretical beginnings I shall describe the system briefly in its presentform.  This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are notfamiliar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance ofsome of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how amachine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derivedfrom a study of natural language, developed out of research into principles for a new general classification.  PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in somerespects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings.Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index,PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribedlist of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of anopen-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into theindex at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature.Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms arehandled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and thesemantic sides of the system.
