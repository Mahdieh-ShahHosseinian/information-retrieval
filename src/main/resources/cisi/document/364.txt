  This study addresses itself to several questions important to all publiclibraries.  How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds ofbooks should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Whydo some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the variousservices provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library taketo improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among thedifferent circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books tobe checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is aninvestment in a security system worthwhile?  We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - theBeverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodologyfor determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that aroseduring our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library,our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public libraries.
