  As early as 1961, we in the engineering Department ofDu Pont recognized the need for a better system forrecording chemical structure information for storage andsubsequent retrieval.  We believed that current methodsand the then current development of notation systemswould not completely serve our chemists' long rangechemical identification needs.  Accordingly, we studied and then developed a chemicalstructure storage and search system.  Huber gave a goodreview of the various approaches and applications.  To usehis terminology, our system is topological coding.  Our initial investigation led to singling out the followingneeds for such a system.
