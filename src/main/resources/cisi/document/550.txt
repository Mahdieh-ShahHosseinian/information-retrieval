  Interlibrary loan transactions involving academic libraries in the UnitedStates numbered over 800,000 items in 1963-64.  This number is growingexponentially.  Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a thirdof the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loansare costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce theusefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loanfailures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lendinglibraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials andby determining in advance what library owns the item wanted.
