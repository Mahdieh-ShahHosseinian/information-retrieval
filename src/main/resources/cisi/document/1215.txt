        Since the first edition of Library of Congress subjectheadings appeared 60 years ago, American and other librarieshave increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority --if not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There canbe no quarrel about the practical necessity for such alabor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about itsvalue as a global standardizing agent, a means for achievingsome uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic.Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as toordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headingsin subject catalogs as far removed geographically asWashington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarshipare, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally,manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed andsubsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of theworldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realmof headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, withhumanity--the LC list can only "satisfy" parochial, jingoisticEuropeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominallyChristian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortablysituated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largelydomiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the EstablishedOrder, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of Western civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed, obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to youngpeople and women.  And exudes something less than sympathy oreven fairness toward organized labor and the sexually unorthodox or"avant-garde."
