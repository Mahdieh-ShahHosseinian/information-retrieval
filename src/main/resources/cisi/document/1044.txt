  The word communication will be used here in a very broad senseto include all of the procedures by which one mind may affectanother.  This, of course, involves not only written and oralspeech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theatre, the ballet,and in fact all human behavior.  In some connections it may bedesirable to use a still broader definition of communication,namely, one which would include the procedures by means ofwhich one mechanism (say automatic equipment to track anairplane and to compute its probably future positions) affectsanother mechanism (say a guided missile chasing this airplane).  The language of this memorandum will often appear to refer tothe special, but still very broad and important, field of the communication of speech; but practically everything said appliesequally as well to music of any sort, and to still or movingpictures, as in television.
