     The United States has been engaged in activities knownvariously as technical assistance, technical cooperation, ordevelopment assistance for the past twenty-five years.  Thisform of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privatelysupported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broaderconcept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing another country with any kind of goods, whether financial,commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, andextends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may bedefined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques,is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallelsAmerica's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognitionas an important industrial and trade power.  Government useof such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well asthe integration of these private and public efforts in the foreignassistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt'sGood Neighbor Policy.  This integration soon expanded underthe new cultural relations program which the UnitedStates implemented during World War II to offset the Nazipropaganda and cultural offensive in Latin America.
