  These authors collected a large number of references to a certain subject,and arranged the periodicals in which the references occurred in order ofdecreasing productivity.  Thus for applied geophysics they found (loc. cit.,p. 112) 1 periodical containing 93 references, 1 containing 86, 4 containing16, 49 containing 2, and 169 containing only 1 reference.  They then madecumulative totals for the two sets of figures, so that in the T most productiveperiodicals there occurred in all R references.  Bradford then plotted log Tagainst R and his curves are reproduced as B and C in Fig. 1.  An exactlysimilar procedure for periodical references borrowed by Butterwick resultedin curve A.  In both A and B, after an initial steep rise (up to about R = 500),the curves approximate to a straight line, R = a log T + b.
