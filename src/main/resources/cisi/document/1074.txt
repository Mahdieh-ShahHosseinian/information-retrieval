  For a number of reasons mentioned it is proposed to reorganize in a newedition the existing UDC completely, to reallocate the subject fields ofthe UDC main classes according to present day views, state of knowledge andpriorities, and to subdivide these main classes only by subfields of subjectfields.  The specific facets of each field should be represented by a uniformarray of special auxiliaries attached to the fields through the techniqueof interrupted subdivision.  These should express the following categories:(1) Theory, (2) Objects, (3) Processes, (4) Attributes, (6) Order, organization,(7) Relation, (8) Determination, (9) Evaluation. ((5) is left free for the moment).  Proposals for further simplification of the scheme are outlinedregarding the general categories, the symbols used and the rules for syntagmatic organization taking into account the implications of computertechnology.  Possible changes in the layout and editions of a new UDC arediscussed.
