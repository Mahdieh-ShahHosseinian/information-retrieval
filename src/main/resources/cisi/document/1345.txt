   A widespread conception of the development of science holds that the greatdiscoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of scientists.. Those historians and philosophers of science who express thispoint of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integralpart of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop apyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists..An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsiblefor advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and NationalAcademy members of today, are the "pedestrians" of history..   This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for thefield of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawnfrom a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second froma subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a thirdfrom a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published byvarious types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the research produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implicationsof these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areasfor necessary future research are suggested..
