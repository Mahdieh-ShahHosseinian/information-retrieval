  This book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over sevenyears.  We have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint productto which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified tomake.  There is no senior author; the sequence of name is simplyalphabetical, and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhereto emphasize this fact.  Our collaboration was motivated by our sharedinterest in social stratification, our common concern with advancingscientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and theconviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualificationsand viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubtthat our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ toa considerable degree.  Although we agree that refining research methodsand advancing social theory are both important, for example, it isonly fair to state that Duncan lays more stress on deriving theoreticalgeneralizations.
