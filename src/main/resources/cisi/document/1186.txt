    This book is about the theory of formal organizations.  It iseasier, and probably more useful, to give examples of formal organizationsthan to define the term.  The United States Steel Corporation is a formalorganization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New YorkState Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part ofa larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposeswe need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawnaround an organization or the exact distinction between an "organization" anda "nonorganization."  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the worldhas an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into cleanclassifications.    Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with whichthey are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged.We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However muchorganizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives andadministrators, and however many books for these practitioners have been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificantplace in modern social science.  Most current psychology andsociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to thesubject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology(Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, "industrialsocial psychology" (with only passing references to organizations),leadership, and voting behavior.  There is no comparable chapter onformal organizations, and only scattered reference to them throughoutthe text.
