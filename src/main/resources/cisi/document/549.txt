    In one broad category of theories, the problems are expressedin terms of actualities of events in group relations as theyexist in everyday life.  On the whole, theories advanced bymany social scientists fall in this broad category.  In thisconcern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated anddiscussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously.In the second broad category of theories, problems are statedand analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearingconcepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologistsand social scientists heavily influenced by them fall withinthis broad category.  In this line of approach, theories areadvanced without due regard to actualities, and consequentlythey are plagued with serious questions of validity.
