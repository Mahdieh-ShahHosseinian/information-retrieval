   To index successfully in the Defense Documentation Center's environment, anautomated system must chose single words or phrases (dependent upon context)rapidly and economically.. The automation of DDC's indexing has been machine-aided from its inception.. A machine-aided indexing (MAI) system is described that indexes one million words of text per hour of CPU time.. Grammatical errors do not exceed five per cent of the output, so human screening is satisfactorily low.. The system could potentially scale up to anoperational size of 10 million words of text per year - the equivalent of adozen bibles or a third of the Encyclopedia Britannica.. In a batch mode, theprograms to accomplish this indexing would require no more than fifteen minutesof CPU time per week..
