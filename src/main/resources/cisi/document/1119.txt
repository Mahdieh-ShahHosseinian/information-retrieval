   The results are described of research and development activities of the Mechanized Information Retrieval Laboratory of the NIITEKHIM.. Research Institute aimed towards creating a descriptor language for an informationretrieval system in the field of chemistry and chemical engineering.. Theobjectives of an optimum reduction of retrieval noise and maximum recall have required the introduction of grammatical and transformational devices into thelanguage.. The former condition is provided for by a matrix notation of document search patterns and requests, while the latter condition is met withthe help of the transformational devices of the language..   Examples of search requests and patterns are considered, which illustratethe "resolution" of the grammatical and transformational devices being developed.. These are said largely to eliminate subjectiveness in assigningrelational factors in search patterns and requests..   The relevancy criterion is formulated.. A retrieval algorithm based on thiscriterion has been compiled..   Experimental searches were conducted on a Minsk-22 computer.. The results were analyzed to evaluate the grammatical and transformational devices and toverify indexing principles devised for the automated retrieval system underdevelopment..   Factors of "silence" are discussed, as well as the contribution of the grammatical and transformational devices to reducing noise and enhancing recall..
