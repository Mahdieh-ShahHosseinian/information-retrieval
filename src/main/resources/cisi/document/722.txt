  Some methods of estimating the minimum amounts of information in a documentnot retrievable through its title are discussed.  An analysis of the informationtransferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning searchstrategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articlesare not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are usedas synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journalarticles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistryare more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alertingand other services based on titles requires a good understanding of theunderlying information transfer principles.
