        The branch of information theory devoted to situations in which theentropy of the source exceeds the capacity of the channel is called ratedistortion theory.  The name derives from C.E. Shannon's concept of therate distortion function of an information source with respect to a fidelitycriterion, which serves as the cornerstone of the theory.  Rate distortiontheory provides a mathematical basis for the rapidly evolving branch ofcommunication engineering commonly referred to as "data compression,""bandwidth compression," or "redundancy reduction."
