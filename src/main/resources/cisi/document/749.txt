  The term statistical bibliography seems to have been first used by E.Wyndham Hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the Sandars Readerin bibliography at the University of Cambridge.  Subsequently the lectureswere published as a book.  Although the debt has never been explicitlyrecognized by means of citations, Hulme anticipated modern work on thehistory of science.  He used the term to mean the illumination of theprocesses of science and technology by means of counting documents.  Hulmeboth summarized the results of Cole and Eales and produced original workon the growth of UK patents (relating these to social progress in theUK) and on the changes displayed in the International Catalogue ofScientific Literature (relating changes in subject and country productionof literature to international developments).
