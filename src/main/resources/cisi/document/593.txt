   ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimentalsystem for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handlelarge amounts of highly variable information which it processes on command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations..At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skillsof a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trainedlibrarians..   Such a system presents programming problems that will be typicalof large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paperdiscusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may proveuseful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (displayformat, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptabilityfor the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-lettermnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (linenumbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use ofdefault conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification;and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..
