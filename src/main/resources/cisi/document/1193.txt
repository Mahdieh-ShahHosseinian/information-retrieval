   This paper presents a method for compacting proper given names for computerstorage.. The method presented uses x-grams which are combinations of from oneto eight letters.. Rather than spelling names letter by letter, they are "spelled" with x-grams..   An algorithm as been implemented in a computer program and used to obtainsets of x-grams for two large (42,165 and 43,875) given name samples.. Usingthe x-grams obtained, it was possible to represent the names from one sample in1.78 bits per original character and in 2.1 bits per original character in thesecond sample..
