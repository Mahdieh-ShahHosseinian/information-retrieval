  The basic plan for this book was evolved during the summer of 1959.At that time I was working on a chapter entitled "Industrial SocialPsychology" for the annual Review of Psychology.  I was impressed bythe large amount of research being conducted in the field, but foundthe task of integrating that research and of identifying the progressmade during the period of the review exceedingly difficult.  In part,this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigatorsin the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they usedto study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparenttheoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to behighly specific and inadequately defined.  There was little standardizationof terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processesunderlying empirical data.
