  The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country'sresearch and development activities and the vigor and the growth of itsindustrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expendituresfor research and development have increased from a modestannual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which werealmost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today.These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional productrepresented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledgewhose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  Thesophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products inwhich we engage today, which require vast research expenditures tofind the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or themost accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces anincrease in the national level of scientific and technological competencethat has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  Thevalue of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application canbe estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate ofbillions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increasedtechnical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting furthereconomic and industrial development, this technical inventory is afactor of major importance.
