   The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) providesinformation from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, governmentand universities.. The center was designed to meet user needs by providing a variety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and ahigh degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 softwaresystem was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSChave run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware,computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All databases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employsa directory and character string type of the structure..   User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic with any degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base; search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments;full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, or weight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper,or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile andmonitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequency list and KLIC indexes..   Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, and improve Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems,personnel functions and services.. The many advantages of computerized retrieval, which are the raison d'etre for the center, include: coverage,thoroughness, consistency, interdisciplinariness, recall, speed, regularity,file preparation and cost effectiveness..
