  A monitor system based upon computer-produced printed indexes is described inthis paper.  The system is intended to monitor a large scale experiment in fileorganization for a real-time, interactive chemical information system.  It isbased upon a topological screen system that ensures the inclusion of everycompound atom (including H) in at least one screen assignment, that appears tobe responsive to a broad range of query types, and that is amenable to random-access techniques.  The Monitor system is also considered, in this paper, asan independent interim approach toward fulfilling, in an effective and economicmanner, the functional requirements of a small- to medium-sized chemical information system.  Thus it could be used to encode and generate structurefiles, to assign search screens, and to provide manual substructure searchcapability via microfilm or hard copy printed indexes.
