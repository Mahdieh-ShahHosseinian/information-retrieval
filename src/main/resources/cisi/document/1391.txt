   Subject analysis for information retrieval is an areawhich always seems deceptively simple to those withoutprevious background in it, however extensive their backgroundin specific subject disciplines may be.  The basicrequirement seems easy enough: to structure the statementof a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, andretrieved from, an ordered file.   While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complexterms or even single words, it always becomesevident that single words are often insufficient to express asubject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex.To express such subjects requires either that their constituentconcepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined,or that only one part of the subject be shown.   The former solution requires that the indexer performthe necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate theconstituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latterforces the seeker of information to sort through many itemsto find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, andma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of theconcept an entry should be made.
