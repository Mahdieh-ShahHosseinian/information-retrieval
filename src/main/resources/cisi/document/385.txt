  In these days of large government programs intended to reduce poverty,develop communities, prevent delinquency and crime, control disease, andreconstruct cities, the predominant rhetoric is that of planning, pilotprojects, experimental and demonstration programs - and evaluation.  Thosewho seek to select for support the more promising plans and projects submittedto funding agencies have become habituated to the ritualistic inclusion inthe proposal of a final section on Evaluation.  In most cases this sectionconsists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent andprocedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action.  In some casesthere is an elegant, highly academic, and impractical scheme worked out inmeticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant.  In a fewtreasured instances there is a well-considered, realistic, and workmanlikeplan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what workedand why.
