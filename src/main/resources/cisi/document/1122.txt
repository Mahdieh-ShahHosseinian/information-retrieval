   A study has been carried out dealing with the development of science interms of sets of scientific and technical data.. It is assumed that the characteristics of a rank distribution provide unbiased data to reflect theprocess of differentiation of sciences..   Rank distribution over the sets of scientific and technical information arecharacterized by the formation of a "kernel" of the distribution and of the"problematic" nature as a phenomenon..   A mathematical model is considered to be used for computing the values ofthe "kernelness" and "problematicity" of a rank distribution..
