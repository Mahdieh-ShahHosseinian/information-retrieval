  A recognition of the importance of useful evaluative techniques is an indirect or secondary result of the hugely expanded national investment in scientific research.  Such recognition has followed the expenditure of much timeand money on the development of information systems which utilize advances ininformation handling and data processing (primarily computer-oriented) tohandle the "explosion" of recorded information.  Information scientists froma typically diverse group of parent disciplines are now cooperating not onlyto develop methodologies of evaluation of such systems, but to apply them.
