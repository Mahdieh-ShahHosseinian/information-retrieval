  I am sure you do not need reminding of the flood of scientific informationthat is available today and the estimates of its growth in the next twodecades.  In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Randcorporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase fromfive million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and theirtotal productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assessthe associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merelystated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which sciencewould actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concernthe publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if wedo not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we willnot be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will becomeredundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would beironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regardthe chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort outwhat is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change,select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs ofthe scientist to this mass of information.
