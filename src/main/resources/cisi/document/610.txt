   A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which canbe used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects orconcepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales onwhich a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in thedevelopment of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or moreindependent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identifythose clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-orientedreference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..   Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line referenceretrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled "evaluative-specific" and accounted for over 23% of the totalvariance.. Factor II was called "desirability"; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled "enormity" accountedfor over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factorstructure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived threedimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more generalclass of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured systemevaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..   In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjectivescales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structureand the need for a predicative replication of the study..
