  Such phrases as "information flow" may be purely metaphorical, or may refer toporterage and storage of physical documents, transmission of signals, powerrequired for signaling, Shannon's Selective Information, changes in the state ofone's personal knowledge, propagation of announcements concerning messages, social increase of awareness, propagation of or reaction to imperatives, and soon.  These matters are distinct and must be distinguished.  Then conditions mustbe stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow.In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention anddelivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formedby choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source,Destination, and Designation.  "Flow" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common,forming a tetrad.  Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables isinextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair.Between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow,according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used toachieve the flow.
