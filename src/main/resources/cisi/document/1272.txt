  Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies ofscientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements abouttrends in science.  For example, there has been a continuing interest in thequestion of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on itsage.  These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the majorbranches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interestedin identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future.Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to pushthese analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subjectdivision, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographicalproperties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect ofsuch work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline.We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a statistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the appearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its firstappearance can such an area be identified?
