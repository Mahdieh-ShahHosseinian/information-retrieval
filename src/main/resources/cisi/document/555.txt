    Librarianship classifies as a social science because the library, as aninstitution, is a creature of society, and its goal is the improvement ofsociety by helping the individual to understand himself and the world ofwhich he is a part.  But the library is also concerned with man as a rational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  Thetraditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking downand in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, inboth its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the socialand physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for thetechnology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may losesight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicitin them.
