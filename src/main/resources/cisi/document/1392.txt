  The first edition of this book, published in 1969, was promptedby changes in the Library Association syllabus which for the first timeenables lecturers to treat classification and subject cataloging asdifferent aspects of the same topic.  These changes coincided with thepublication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showedclearly that all indexing languages are basically the same.  However,although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was noone textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I feltwas needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and itsreception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill areal need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and -more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States,where British textbooks on classification had previously been regardedwith something akin to suspicion.  (As the Dean of one Americanlibrary school is alleged to have remarked, 'What theory of classification?')
