   Some parameters and techniques in use for describing the results of tests on IR systems are analysed.. Several considerations outside the score of the usual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters.. In particular, avariable which produces a 'performance curve' of a system corresponds to anextension of the 2x2 table.. Also, the statistical relationships betweenparameters are all-important.. It is considered that precision is not such auseful measure of performance (in conjunction with recall) as fallout.. A morepowerful alternative to Cleverdon's 'inevitable inverse relationship betweenrecall and precision' is proposed and justified, namely that the recall-falloutgraph is convex..
