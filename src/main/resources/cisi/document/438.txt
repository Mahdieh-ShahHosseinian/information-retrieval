  This book summarizes the results of three years of research at theCenter for Educational Policy Research.  The eight coauthors were allResearch Associates at the Center, and our work there was a collaborativeeffort.  We plagiarized both ideas and data from one another.  Most ofus also spent a good deal of time criticizing one another's work.  Whileeach of us took primary responsibility for certain lines of inquiry, andthis responsibility is recorded in appropriate footnotes, we see ourresearch as an integrated effort which should bear all our names.
