  In recent years social scientists have given increased attention toproblems of inequality, justice, and discrimination in American society.The influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individualsis being studied in an effort to estimate the "fairness" of socialinstitutions in rewarding talent.  Social scientists are trying todetermine the extent to which so-called "irrelevant" characteristicsinfluence the ways in which people are judged by social institutionsand eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income,prestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society,science has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Littleis known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This bookexamines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratificationof individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance,or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment?A more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whetheruniversalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis forrecognition in the social system of science.
