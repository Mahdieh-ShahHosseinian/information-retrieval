  Chemical Abstracts Service, along with the entire ACS publicationsprogram, is converting to a computer base.  This change in our basic methodof handling information will provide powerful new tools for chemists andchemical engineers to meet their information needs.  Our goal is a unified system that will produce both a full, printed recordof chemical and chemical engineering knowledge and a variety of timely,special-subject alerting services, simultaneously providing a mechanizedmatch and retrieval system that is sufficiently flexible to meet the variedneeds of information users.  The output will be supplied in whatever formbest suits the user's needs - printed pages, microfilm, or computer-searchabletapes.  Tapes and search programs will be usable on the customer's computer,or CAS will provide custom matches of its own computer files.
