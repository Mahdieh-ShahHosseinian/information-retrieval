  The present paper will first deal with some of the objectives, etiology, andrequirements of the library network as it overtakes and embraces co-operation.Next, in this context of network development, a number of activitiesinvolving special libraries will be reviewed by way of illustration and example.  The greatest proportion of special library interrelationships are,on the surface at least, random and  informal.  We shall therefore concentrateon such arrangements as have about them some measure of structure and intent.Finally, we will deduce from these examples the performance and promisewhich special libraries may offer to a total library network or information system.
