  An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicatorsregarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuliused to represent documents in information retrieval systems.  In effect,since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated uponthe examination of one "level of processing" of the document (e.g., thecitation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the propertiesof what constitutes "relevance".  However, prior to such an analysis, aneven more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portionsof a document should be examined.  An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs),functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documentsby motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlledexperimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediateresponse products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph,last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would berepresentative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation andabstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that:    1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment       groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match       the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document;    2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted       relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs;    3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and    4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not       substantive.  Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previouswork with unmotivated subjects.
