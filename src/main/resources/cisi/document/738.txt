  The increasing availability of computer-readable files of chemical  nomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the developmentof methods for performing substructure searches in which CA nomenclatureterms are used as search terms.  Substructure searches on CA Indexnomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topologicalsearches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety ofsearches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also containnonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance datacan often be done within a single search of a file with both high recalland relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possiblefor persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to constructnomenclature profiles for many questions.
