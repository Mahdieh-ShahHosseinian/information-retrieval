  As my title might suggest, I wish to discuss some aspects of Palermo's recentpaper.  The thesis which Palermo advocated is that Kuhn's view of scientificrevolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology, andthat, in particular, experimental psychology has had two paradigms already,with the appropriate scientific revolution between them, and that the currentbehavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of Kuhnian crisis.  Thepresent note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo's assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was astandard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first,challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as aKuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorismis in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons forthis.
