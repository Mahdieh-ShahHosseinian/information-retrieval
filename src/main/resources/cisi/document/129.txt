  This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use ofmachine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  Itis therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is preparedin general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.  The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applicationsused in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is consideredto be an organized collection of machine-readable records containingbibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).The data bases that we will consider are used for information storageand retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval ordata base generation.  The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First,data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographicinformation, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Numberis a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such asthat by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic materialis included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, mostof the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in ashipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of thischapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generationof publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that productionoperation.
