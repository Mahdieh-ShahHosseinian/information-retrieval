  Microforms enjoy only limited acceptance in research libraries, largelybecause of user resistance.  A growing number of published studies indicatethat improper production, inadequate bibliographic access, lack of standardization, defects in equipment design, maintenance problems,poor environments for microform usage, and certain inherent characteristicsof the microforms themselves all combine to make their use inconvenient.Solutions to most of these problems have existed for some time, but themicroform industry has been slow to correct them.  Some positive developmentshave occurred in the last two years, but the major problems remain.
