  This volume represents what we believe to be as completeand thorough an analysis as possible of the available economicdata on college and university libraries.  In the courseof our study, we have examined the data for comprehensivenessand consistency; we have investigated their intertemporalbehavior, both as a basis for projection and as aninstrument for long-range planning; and we have constructeda set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derivestatistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the mostcritical economic variables relating to library operations.  Inparticular, in the course of this last step, we have providedrelationships explaining statistically the determination ofsuch variables as the size of libraries' budgets and themagnitude of their professional staffs.
