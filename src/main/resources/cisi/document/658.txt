   The criteria employed by engineers in the selection of various technicalinformation channels in problem-solving endeavors are investigated.. Therelationships of certain criteria identified in past research to such factors as frequency of channel utilization and the rate at which engineers accept orreject technical information received from specific channels are the focal points of the study.. A direct relationship is founded between perceivedaccessibility of information channels and several objective measures of utilization, whereas no definite support is found for the hypothesis that the channel perceived highest in technical quality are those used most frequently..
