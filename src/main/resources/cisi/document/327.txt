  Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in scienceare at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamentaleffects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge.These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computertechniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientificand technical information.  Many of the implications of the changesare not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from alabour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaringman-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information andincreasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access.But the changes to be effected also have major social implications;the reasons for publication and use of information are complex,reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information-handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by theirappreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer,but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operatorsof information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to theirperception of the usefulness of the newer methods.
