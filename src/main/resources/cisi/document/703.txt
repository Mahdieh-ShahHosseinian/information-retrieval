  The mechanization of chemical information retrieval systems until now has beenlimited to those organizations that have access to extensive computer facilities.  Now, small, low-cost computers, such as IBM's 1130 or DEC's PDP-11,are available with input/output capacities that make them suitable for SDIand retrospective searching  on any of the many commercially available databases.  Such a machine, located at the New England Research Application Center (NERAC), is described and the problems of using it for chemical informationretrieval are discussed.  NERAC's SDI Chemical Search System is described,and an example profile is used to illustrate its capabilities.
