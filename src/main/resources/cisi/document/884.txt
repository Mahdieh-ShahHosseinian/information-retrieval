    There is little so ephemeral as a "Current review" in an area so rapidlychanging as library networking.  Yet this very characteristic of rapid changemakes valid the effort of providing an overview at a point in time.    The first task, then, is network definition and description, necessarybecause a large number of library activities have been described as "networks"and only a limited number are covered here.  The chapter on "Library andInformation Networks" in volume seven of the Annual Review of InformationScience and Technology provides a "normative list" of "essential characteristics":    1. A network's function is to marshal resources ... to accomplish results       beyond the ability of any one of its members.    2. A network has developed an organizational design and structure that       allows it to establish an identifiable domain....    3. It has a base in communications technology.
