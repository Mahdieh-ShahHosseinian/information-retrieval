  All the research reported in this book arose out of an attempt, someyears ago, to study an industrial concern as a 'community of people atwork', that is, in much the same terms one would use in a study ofconduct and relationships in a village, an urban neighborhood, or asmall primitive community.  This aim was never realized, because itsoon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlockedwith, and often mirrored, that of the small isolated town in which itwas situated.  The wider study which then appeared necessary was notpracticable and the enquiry petered out rather inconclusively, assumingits present significance only in the context of later studies.
