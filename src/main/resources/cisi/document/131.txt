  Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiryhas begun to take shape.  This field, which will be referred to as "InformationScience and Technology," draws on fragments and fringes of a numberof sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The elementthat provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is ashared deep concern with "information" - its generation, transformation,communication, storage, retrieval, and use.  Because of the universality of information processes, and also becauseof the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is verylittle agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology,or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put itsimply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understoodfield of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell,even clear agreement on what the word "information" itself means andparticularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or acommodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged.Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they neednot and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interestto users, designers, and students of information systems and services.The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume,is to provide such a review.
