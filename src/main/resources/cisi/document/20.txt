     Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianshipfrom the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 andthe appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic andcontroversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter.     But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era inthe history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advancesin the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was tohave considerable influence on the course of library development inAmerica after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenthcentury is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era,and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriateand useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the foundingof the American Library Association.
