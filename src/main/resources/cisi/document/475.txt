The subjects were then asked to rate the methods on aseven point scale according to (a) ease of use and (b) amount of information expected.. The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their timespent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated"research" and "nonresearch"..   A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 innonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel..
