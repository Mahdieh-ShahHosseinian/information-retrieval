   The imbalance between medical library resources and information needs of thehealth professional led to a reexamination of the mandate for the National Library of Medicine.. Legislation known as the Medical Library Assistance Act(MLAA) was passed in 1965 which enabled the NLM to (1) initiate programs to assist the nation's medical libraries and (2) develop a medical library networkwith the establishment of regional medical libraries to link the NLM with localinstitutions..   The National Library of Medicine, through the MLAA, has made available $40.8million to the medical library community under a competitive grant and contract mechanism for the period July 1965 - June 1970.. A total of 604 projects has been executed in resources, research and development, training, construction,regional medical libraries, publications, and special scientific projects.. Anassessment is given of each of these programs and their impact on both the National Library of Medicine and individual medical libraries.. In the aggregate, these programs have significantly improved library and informationservices to the professional health user.. The principal limitation has beeninadequate funding to accomplish the level of originally stated objectives..
