  The main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoreticaland experimental nature rather than on practicalapplications.  However, the articles selected are viewedas having a considerable potential in two major respects:they have important implications for the practice ofinformation handling, but even more important, they containaspects of generalization.  The book is orientedtoward basic and experimental work, such as thatperformed by traditional sciences, with the hope that areader may find much relevant to his own interests,educational level and background, a bridge towardgeneralizations, a feeling of interconnection betweenseemingly unrelated works either presented in the book orfound in the literature, an awareness of apparent gaps inknowledge, and even ideas for practical solutions orfurther theoretical or experimental work.
