   Starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing withcomputers, the experiment in automatic document classification proceedsto construct anempirically based, mathematically derived classification system by use of afactor analysis technique.. The documents are then classified into these derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification servesas a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated..Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more cluewords, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maronin a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of classification categories and a different computational formula.. The experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification technique..
