  In his book on Documentation (1948) the librarian, S.C. Bradford,discussed certain regularities in the pattern of distribution of articles on a particular subject over different journals.  He gives as examples thedistributions for geophysics from 1928-31 inclusive and lubrication for1931 to June, 1933, inclusive.  The typical picture is one in which, to abibliography covering a certain short term of years, a few journals contributea large number of articles, more journals contribute fewer and so on ina monotonic sequence ending with a large number of journals contributingone article each.  Patterns of this kind have been observed by severalauthors, but Bradford was the first, I think, to advance an explanation ofthe effect in bibliographical terms.
