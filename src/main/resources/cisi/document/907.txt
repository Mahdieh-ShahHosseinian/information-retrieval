    This book, Libraries at Large, is itself one tangible outcome of Advisory Commission activity, representing the combined efforts of Duke University,the R.R. Bowker Company, members of the Commission and its several studygroups, and many other diverse individuals within and without the libraryworld.  The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work ofour Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individualin our society be provided with library and informational services adequateto his current and emerging needs.  Confronting this goal requires arecognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisitefor the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.  Thenational interest demands simultaneous sympathy with people in pockets ofilliteracy and people in the vanguards of intellectual achievement.
