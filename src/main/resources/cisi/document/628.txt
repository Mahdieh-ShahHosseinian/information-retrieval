   It has been suggested that information science is still of the stageof alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form itsphilosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to theobservable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series ofexamples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beachesand man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena likecontinental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is alsoconsidered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..   Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mentalpowers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusiveseries of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusivethinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, andthis results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, itis observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard toexisting classifications and is more likely to be involved in anintegrated approach to problems..
