  This chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art intesting and evaluation.  Three tasks will be undertaken: to outline insome detail the few substantive research projects involving testing andevaluation, to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate totesting and evaluation, and finally, to provide some general conclusionswith respect to past and future activity.  Although a distinction is madein this review between laboratory-based experimentation and tests ofoperational systems, the methodology used in each instance is substantiallythe same.  As yet, no full-scale and elaborate field approach has beenattempted.
