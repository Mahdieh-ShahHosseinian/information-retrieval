  The American urban public library is in something of a dilemma. Relatively secure in the affections of the populace, the library is neverthelessfrequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and areassociated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notablyobscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations forthe libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both becausethe libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts werepreposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find that tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce acritical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think theexperience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive.Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic success. The paradox invites some critical self-analysis.
