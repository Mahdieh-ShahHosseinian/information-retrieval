  Case Studies in Library Computer Systems does not follow the mode ofthe other volumes in this series because none of the persons, libraries orsystems is disguised.  Neither has information been withheld to force readerstp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, allsystems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptivecase studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situationin which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfullyutilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method ratherthan the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important todescribe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the contextof a real library environment and against the background of particularinstitutional service objectives.
