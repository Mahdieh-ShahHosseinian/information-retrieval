   Throughout my years of work as an information scientist I have beenplagued by a personal and professional sense of doubt with respect to thefield.. A central theme of every conference that I have attended relatedto:  "What is information science?" Or "Is information science a science?"In this paper I hope to take these questions head on.. I must begin bysaying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I seeit as the quest for understanding of the nature of information andman's interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest forunderstanding is the greatest challenge of the science..   I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on thescientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view isthe scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment tothe present.. I also intend to look critically at what I perceiveto be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understandthe phenomenon of information.. The criticism will by necessity bespeculative.. I intend to stick my neck out, not because I can provemy assertions, but because I believe these ideas must be discussed..
