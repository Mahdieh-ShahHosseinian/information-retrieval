   Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the setsof periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively largeerrors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported andbecause they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work onobsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..   When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there stillremains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicalsthat contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period thanthose of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the conceptof "utility contours" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p%library..   It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggestnew measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques thatare applicable to any other special case..
