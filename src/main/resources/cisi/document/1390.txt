  The rapid development of information retrieval methods sincethe last war - together with the development of systems usingmechanical or electromechanical means (punched cards) for suchpurposes followed later by electronic retrieval (computers) - haveled to transformations in the structure of classification or codingsystems for books and documents.  Generally speaking, documentspecialists have tended to elaborate a large number of differentcodes, usually totally unrelated to each other, each conceivedto meet the special documentation requirements of a particularorganization.  This is farther than ever - at least to allappearances - from the original intention of 1895 of the foundersof the Institut International de Bibliographie (now known as theFederation Internationale de Documentation), i.e., the standardizationof classification methods.
