   Two groups of journals were identified as potential sources forcardiovascular (c-v) information.. The first group consists of 78 c-vspecialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title..These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialtyjournals being published by 28 national and international societies.. Thesecond group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees ofthe National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings..   In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reportedto NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S.c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not themost quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14%of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of theliterature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v journals..   The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing andabstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-rankingjournals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..
