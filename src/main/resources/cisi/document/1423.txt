  A university library is both a collegiate library and a research library.It is collegiate in its provision of books and other documentary recordsto support the students' program of instruction and to encourage thehabit of reading and the use of libraries.  As does the college library,the university library must also provide materials for use by the facultymembers in the preparation of their courses of instruction and by the staffof the institution in the performance of their administrative responsibilities.However, the university library differs from the college library in offeringa wider range of undergraduate programs, offering graduate instruction beyondthe Master's level, and usually offering advanced professional programs in anumber of fields.
