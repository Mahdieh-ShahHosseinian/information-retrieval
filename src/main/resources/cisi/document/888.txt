  The Documentation Research Project of the American Institute has beenengaged for some years in an effort to improve the various systems availablefor the publication and dissemination of physics literature.  Numerousaspects of the problem have been studied and much information has beenobtained from the projects listed in the bibliography which appears onthe inside cover of this Report.  Studies which resulted in the determinationof the indexing requirements of research physicists, new methods for thecontent analysis and indexing of physics research papers, and betterproduction methods for journal indexes have formed the backbone of the workwhich has as its ultimate objective the creation of a reference retrieval system which is adequate for the physicists who will use it.
