  This presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is basedon data gathered by Project URBANDOC during the course of four years indeveloping documentation services for the literature of urban planningand renewal.  It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars isno small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban RenewalDemonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated theProject in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographicservices in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarianswere looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems.URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body ofliterature which had been neglected by the information science community beforethe advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards.
