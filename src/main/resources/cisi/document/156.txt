  May we please raise four questions which are important at the present timewhen government policy on information retrieval is being considered? Thesearise from results recently produced by SDC which are germane to Dr.Somerfield's paper on 'Computer-based Information Services' (AslibProceedings, 20, 12, 542-50 (1968)), and to OSTI's work in this field.  The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various publishedindexes and other sources of scientific information and the first resultsof rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case studyon the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This resultsfrom an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collatingresults of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry andspectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearlytwo hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'were found and are being checked individually for relevance going backto the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary.
