  Index names for chemical substances have been significantly revised byChemical Abstracts Service (CAS) for Volume 76 [January-June 1972, the firstvolume of the Ninth Collective Period (1972-1976)] and subsequent volumes ofChemical Abstracts.  While remaining generally within the framework of IUPACand other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended nameshave been chosen.  These names are more easily derived from molecular structuraldiagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users.  Machineediting of index names and translation of these names into structuralrepresentations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aidedby the revisions.  The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all"trivial" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplificationof general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment forcertain classes of substances.  Specific identifiable alloys, elementaryparticles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventionalchemical substances.  Difficulties encountered with generation of previousChemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisonsare made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituentradicals.
