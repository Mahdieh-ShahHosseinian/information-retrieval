  The purpose of this volume is to give an insight into the nature and scopeof the documents of international organizations and to provide informationabout the work of documentalists and librarians in making the mass ofinformation available in these documents available to readers.  All too manylibrarians regard government documents and in particular, the documents ofinternational agencies as esoteric, unlike the usual library materials informat and publication pattern, and as presenting problems of acquisitions,control and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left tothe specialist in documents.  The result is that international documents area puzzlement to the general librarian, and a source of frustration to theill informed administrator; a situation exacerbated by the present generaltendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of internationaldocuments except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions ofa general course in government documents to which relatively few studentsare exposed.  The information in this volume will allay the fears of thegeneralist librarian.  It also provides the data on which to base additionalemphasis on international documents in the library school curriculum.
