  The co-joining of "design" with "evaluation" that is called for by thischapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for theauthor.  In part, "design" and "evaluation" prescribe two separate setsof activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, andtesting of new information system structures and modification of existingstructures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operationalsystems and system components.  However, "design" includes not only theformulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions forevaluation in accordance with expectations.  "Evaluation" applies totesting design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementationsfor the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to theappraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of systemoperability may yield data that indicate the need for system modificationsthat require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of "design" and"evaluation" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated inhis 1969 review.  "Design" and "evaluation" may be examined methodologically or withrespect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly,designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence ofoutcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literaturediscloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as ontheir products.
