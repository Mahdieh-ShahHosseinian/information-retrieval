  Our point of departure is a study of the feasibility and desirabilityof adapting the British Citizens' Advice Bureau (CAB) plan to theUnited States, carried out with the financial support and cooperationof the Ford Foundation.  We conclude that the British CAB pattern, while creative, richlyimplicative and a major source of valuable guidance, if merely duplicatedwould not make the optimum contribution to the current American scene.  We find overwhelming evidence that new information, advice, referralprovision are necessary.  Localities need and want Neighborhood InformationCenters (NIC's).  We find promising beginnings and a number of attractive possibilitiesemerging out of the somewhat different efforts by a number of federalagencies, local government and local voluntary groups.  However, no oneof these provides auspices for all the needed functions in accord withqualities which we find to be essential.
