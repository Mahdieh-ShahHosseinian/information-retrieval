  Limited physical space expansion, an administrativeconsideration in every library, becomes a stringent factor in the planningof special libraries.  While public and college libraries may have  several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of abuilding or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks arenot overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrialfloorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to thepossible future growth of the library.	Weeding or storage requirements,therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industriallibrary administrators than they are to administrators of other types oflibraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in theserials collections of industrial libraries because so much currenttechnical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study madeby one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journalshas potential for other libraries.
