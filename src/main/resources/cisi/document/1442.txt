  We feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinkingin the last decade.  It is not longer of any interest to describeone after another language 'anyhow' without regard to the relevanceof the facts to general linguistic theory.  As Ross put it, it makesno sense to talk about 'describing a language in terms of its ownstructure alone.'  Toward the end of the conference, when it had becomeapparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currentlyexplicitly formulated model, the question was raised:  What should webe teaching our students?  Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt:We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguisticproblem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light -negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in generalare like.
