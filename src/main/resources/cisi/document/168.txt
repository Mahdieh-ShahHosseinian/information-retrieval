  The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determiningthe interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is byno means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous butrarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt,1836).  His view that a language "makes infinite use of finitemeans" and that its grammar must describe the processes thatmake this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistentconcern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind,with this "creative" aspect of language use (for discussion, seeChomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that evenPanini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a"generative grammar," in essentially the contemporary sense ofthis term.  This monograph is an exploratory study of various problemsthat have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar,which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for thediscussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how thistheory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, withquestions that are at the border of research in transformationalgrammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but moreoften the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possibleapproaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.
