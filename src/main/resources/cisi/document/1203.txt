  The goal of this study is to reach a deeper understanding of someconcepts we believe are crucial to the general theory of computation.We will study in great detail a class of computations that makedecisions by weighing evidence.  Certainly, this problem is ofgreat interest in itself, but our real hope is that understandingof its mathematical structure will prepare us eventually to gofurther into the almost unexplored theory of parallel computers.
