        This outline is based mainly on lectures given at the North-WesternPolytechnic to students studying for the Library Association's RegistrationExamination in Classification and Cataloguing.        It is hoped that it will help to meet the need, increasingly felt in recent years by students and teachers of the subject, for a reasonably simpletextbook on Library Classification which takes account of the considerable developments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years.  As is well known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also,in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments,a coherent theory of library classification has been established in eachof its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and inthe alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.  It is now possible toconstruct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions(of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly)is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.  Moreover, theyare easier to construct.
