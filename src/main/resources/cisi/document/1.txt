   The present study is a history of the DEWEY DecimalClassification.  The first edition of the DDC was publishedin 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editionswill continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC'slong and healthy life, however, its full story has neverbeen told.  There have been biographies of Deweythat briefly describe his system, but this is the firstattempt to provide a detailed history of the work thatmore than any other has spurred the growth oflibrarianship in this country and abroad.
