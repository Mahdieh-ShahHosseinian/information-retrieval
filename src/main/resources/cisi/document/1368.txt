  A survey of the R.E. Gibson Library's journal collection was conductedto determine 1) which journal titles could be discontinued, 2) which journalholdings could be moved to remote storage, and 3) which journal holdingscould be converted to microfilm.  Totals were maintained for three areas ofjournal usage according to: 1) the number of times patrons used current issues, 2) the number of times the journal issues were reshelved by library staff, and 3) the number of times that journals were cited in articles by Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) authors.  The survey resulted in a 9.6% reduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additional shelf space in which to display journals.  Further studies of theaccumulated data are being made to determine which holdings will be sent toa remote storage area which is under construction.  The survey data have beenand will continue to be consulted before any journals are converted to microfilm.
