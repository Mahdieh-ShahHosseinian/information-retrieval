  There is no question that in our age there is a good deal ofturmoil about the manner in which our society is run.  Probably atno prior point in the history of man has there been so much discussionabout the rights and wrongs of the policy makers, whether they be thepoliticians in Albany or Sacramento, in Washington, Paris, or Moscow,the managers of far-flung industrial firms, or the people who runeducational institutions.  In all cases the citizen feels a perfectright to have his say about the way in which the managers manage.  Not only has the citizen become far more vocal, but he has alsoin many instances begun to suspect that the people who makethe major decisions that affect our lives don't know what theyare doing.  They don't know what they are doing simply becausethey have no adequate basis to judge the effects of their decisions.
