  In spite of concerns expressed in the literature aboutthe health and vigor of the field of information science andof its service-oriented institutions - libraries and informationcenters - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds foroptimism.  Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movementtoward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years beforesatisfying experience with this new mode of information access willhelp it become not merely an experimental innovation but thestandard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally)held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactivesystems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, andBrandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and disseminationsystems.  This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentiallygreat importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes.It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, inthe coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction ofsome of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other newareas of interest are information system applications in the criminaljustice system and information system applications in the humanities.  In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areasof information science, which we attempt to review on as close to anannual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document descriptionand representation, and organization of information.  Thiscoverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review masterplan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interestin library and information science.
