  This is a introductory book in the sense that it does not presupposeany previous training in the subject.  But it does assume thatthe reader - especially the reader whose educational background, likemy own, is more in the 'humanities' than in mathematics and'science' - is prepared to make a certain intellectual effort with respectto the use of symbols and formulae.  Few subjects suffer more thanlinguistics from the separation of the 'sciences' and the 'humanities'that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools aduniversities.  For contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously,and in roughly equal measure, upon the more traditional approachto language that is characteristic of the 'humanities' and the more'scientific' approach that has developed recently in connection withadvances that have been made in formal logic, computer science andautomata theory.
