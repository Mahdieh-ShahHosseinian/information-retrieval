  When the Chairman of the Technical Services Cost Committee askedthe three of us to summarize the findings of the Colorado study oncentralized processing, I agreed.  Later, I began to have second thoughts - I suppose because we were almost buried under an avalanche of data and it soon became apparent that we could notreally summarize the findings of the study in one evening.  The investigation took off in tangents that had not been originallyanticipated.  As you have already been informed, the final report dealswith such diverse topics as a faculty user attitude survey, mathematicalmodel simulations of processing center operations, approval planutilization, and an inter-institutional bookkeeping system, all inaddition to the cost studies of acquisitions and cataloging in ninelibraries.
