        This book, is an exercise in sociological theory-building.  It attempts to develop a theory of the social organizationof science.  I have tried to indicate its possible broader relevanceby pointing out certain basic parallels between the "social system"of science and other social systems within society.  I hope, further,that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions Ihave drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seemsnow to exist between those sociologists who are concerned withsociety as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms ofits consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists whoare concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goalsof the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior.My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that mostindividuals, most of the time, come to "want" to do what it isthat society "needs" them to do.  Only when we can answer thisquestion satisfactorily, can we develop a sociology capable of providing both prediction and meaning.
