  No code of cataloguing could be adopted in all points by everyone,because the libraries for study and the libraries for reading have differentobjects, and those which combine the two do so in different proportions.Again, the preparation of a catalogue must vary as it is to be manuscriptor printed, and, if the latter, as it is to be merely an index to thelibrary, giving in the shortest possible compass clues by which thepublic can find books, or is to attempt to furnish more information onvarious points, or finally is to be made with a certain regard to whatmay be called style.
