   This article focuses on the human interaction characteristics of aninformation retrieval system, suggests some design considerations toimprove man-machine cooperation, and describes a research system at Stanford that is exploring some of these techniques..   Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naiveuser formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriatesearch query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, theprocess of query formulation by the user, interactively with theinformation available in te system, remains one of the principalproblems in information retrieval today..   In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interfacecommunication between man and the computer, we have pursued theobjective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRTin a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with alight pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Usinghis passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interactionvocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may beaugmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance tothe user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems toreplicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's probleminto the structure and vocabulary of the system..
