  For several years we have thought that greater effort should beexpended to create more understanding of the processes involved ininformation storage, retrieval, and dissemination.  Too often, conceptsderiving from science and technology are made to seem unnecessarilyabstruse, either inadvertently or deliberately to preserve some sort ofmystique.  This book is intended to explicate, if not popularize, majoraspects of I S & R processes as they are exemplified by the field ofchemical documentation.  To the extent that this work is found usefulby chemists, information specialists, and all individuals interested inscientific documentation, we shall be gratified.
