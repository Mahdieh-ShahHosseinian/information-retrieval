  In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functionsare, in general, not applicable in information retrievalsystems.  First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedlyis to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize someoverall performance rather than certain detailed parts ofit.  This situation is, of course, well known.   Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performanceimplies that the reward varies with different circumstances.That is, there may always be some customers who will not agreethat the system's output is satisfactory.  However, theseshould be relatively few.  In the case of an informationretrieval system, let us consider one whose function is tofurnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.  So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questionsQ, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q)which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot bechosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation betweenthe question and the resulting reference list.  Usuallyone says that the documents in the list are relevant tothe question.  More precisely stated, we assume that theenquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the onehe would have procured had he himself probed the documentsin the set.
