  The expression 'half-life', borrowed from physics, has appearedquite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960, when anarticle by Burton and Kebler on The 'half-life' of some scientific and technicalliteratures was published, although it had certainly been used previously.Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather thandisintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half theactive life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time duringwhich one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerousstudies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establishobsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points outthat different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample ofliterature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accuratemeasures for discriminating between different subject-fields.
