   An algorithm has been developed and implemented to generate for each chemical structure a unique and invariant linear name which includes double bond and asymmetric carbon isomerism.. A logical proof is given for the one-to-one correspondence between name and structure.. By inspection of thelinear names of two structures, one can determine if the two structures areidentical, nonisometric, constitutionally isometric, diastereometric, orenantiometric.. The algorithm determines the true stereocenters and calculatesa reduced set of chiral centers, Src.. It is proven that if three are any centers in Src that the compound must be chiral; an a chiral compound must have Src = null.. Extensions of the algorithm are outlined to allow uniquely naming conformational isomers..
