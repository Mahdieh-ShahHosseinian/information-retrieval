   The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedbackthrough recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain orincrease their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produceeven less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that thedistribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort ofscientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis forchemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases ininequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity,resources and esteem increases as career age increases..
