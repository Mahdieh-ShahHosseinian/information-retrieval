  The objective of the Computer Search Center (CSC) of the Information Sciencessection of IIT Research Institute (IITRI) is to provide a link between a widevariety of users and the rapidly expanding information resources in machine-readable form.  Because none of the available computer search programs metthe criteria of the center, and because of the need to handle a variety of databases, new general purpose computer programs were written, and a tape formatwas developed so that a wide variety of data bases can be searched by the samecomputer program.  The center was designed to provide current awareness andretrospective search services from both document-type and data-type computerizeddata files.  The desire to develop transferable programs for use at manyinstallations prompted the adoption of the machine-independent compiler language PL/1 and the use of IBM 360 series computers.  The objective of education and training led to the development of a "Search Manual" for profilepreparation, the development of a workbook in "Modern Techniques in ChemicalInformation," the teaching of a new academic course, and the presentation ofseminars.
