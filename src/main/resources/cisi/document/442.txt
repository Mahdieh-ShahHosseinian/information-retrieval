   Analysis is made of the effect of using an efficient code of compression ofterms within a document data base.. The storage efficiency  is expressed in terms of the vocabulary length and the values of certain parameters which describe the structure of the code.. For vocabularies of up to 100,000 termsthe average code length is approximately twelve bits.. No information is lostthrough term truncation or abbreviation.. The tables required for coding and decoding may be ordered for rapid access without reduction in the ease of update..
