  This, the fourth volume of the Annual Review of Information Science andTechnology, is both like and unlike its predecessors.  The basic objective -to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress reviewever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do thebasic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continuesto be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify,locate, and examine interesting and important sources of informationabout various aspects of our technical progress.  Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For thefirst time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one onthe international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also,the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usuallycovered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters thisyear.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for bettersignposts within each volume, is the division of the book into severalmajor segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents ofthe section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in someinstances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress.
