Text processing problems (such as automatic translation and automaticabstracting) create a need for defining explicit concepts, which should becharacterized as the properties and quantity of semantic informationcontained in document texts.In fact, we need a formal model, which lets us describe the process ofsemantic text analysis.  Semantic text analysis could be described from the point of view of someonewith a different "conception of the world" - e.g. the text of very meaningfularticle does not contain, in fact, any information for people who are notspecialists in the given mathematic field.Therefore, the formal model must contain descriptions of the "conception of theworld: of the given observer.Such a description we call a thesaurus.  Semantic text analysis we interpret as changing the thesaurus in responseto a given text.
