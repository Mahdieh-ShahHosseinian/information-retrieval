  Each kind of librarianship partakes of the general elements of librarianship,and each has a flavor all its own.  This book is intended to present the flavorand philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice.  If it givesa new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in healthscience organizations, so much the better.  If it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation, it isso no longer.  One must conceive of them as part of a medical system, andindeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicineas practiced by a single physician for a single patient.  It extends intothe health sciences as represented by dentists, pharmacists, nurses,veterinarians, medical technologists, medical associates and dozens ofothers, some not yet possessing a clear identity.  It includes research,education and practice.  In addition to the clinical sciences, the systeminvolves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health.Increasingly, socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstreamof medicine.
