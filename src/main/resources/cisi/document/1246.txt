  This volume is intended as a means of exploration for the practicinglibrarian and as a textbook for the library school student.  It will tryto draw attention to significant social, behavioral, theoretical, organizational, functional, and operational generalizations about libraryinterrelationships; and to suggest a sense of the total fabric of thecooperative endeavor.  It does not aim at identifying and incorporatingthe forms and the range of library cooperation in which individual librariesseek to extend the limits of their separate capabilities.
