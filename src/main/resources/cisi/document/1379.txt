  The following pages form the concluding portion of four lecturesdelivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Readerin Bibliography, 1921.  As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classesof the community, I have decided to print them separately, thoughthe underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity inbook classification as a preliminary to co-operative action inlibrary administration and bibliography.  Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classificationcarried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformityin the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this achronological order of books in their classes and your scheme ofclassification acquires a new value; for it presents for each perioda bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of theactivities of the human mind.  My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practicalapplication to library work and the compilation of subjectbibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered inrelation to the growth of modern civilization.  Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography endswith the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their finalinterpretation should be left to those possessing the necessaryqualifications.  I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting tofurnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factorswhich are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I haveoutstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.  On this countI offer no defense.
