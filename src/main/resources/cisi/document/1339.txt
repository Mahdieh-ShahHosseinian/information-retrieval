  Of the four chapters, added to this edition, two come from publishedsymposia,one of which is out of print and the other of which, I am told,is nearing that same state of exhaustion.  This chapter sets forth the concept of 'the influential,' identifies twodistinctive types of influentials, the 'local' and the 'cosmopolitan,' andrelates these types to the structure of influence in the local community.  The second of these chapters, "Contributions to the Theory of ReferenceGroup Behavior," draws upon the ample evidence provided by The AmericanSoldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselvesto the norms of various groups, in particular the groups with which they arenot affiliated.  The other two chapters added to this edition have not been publishedbefore.  The first of these, "Continuities in the Theory of Social Structureand Anomie," tries to consolidate recent empirical and theoretical analysesof the sources and consequences of that breakdown of social norms which isdescribed as anomie.  The second, "Continuities in the Theory of ReferenceGroups and Social Structure," tries to bring out some of the speciallysociological, as distinct from the socio-psychological, implications ofcurrent inquiries into reference-group behavior.  The intent is to examinesome of the theoretical problems of social structure which must be solvedbefore certain further advances can be made in the sociological analysis ofreference groups.
