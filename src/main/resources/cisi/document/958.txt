   Mathematical models of library operations are presented, allowing managers toestimate measures of effectiveness for a library.. These models describe theamount of use made of resources by a user in a visit, the distribution of bookcirculation in a collection, the dependence of circulation on time, and the effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction.. Predictions are made on the basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into branch libraries.. The effect, in terms of frustrated use, of removing the least-used books from a collection is discussed, as are strategies for forduplication.. The emphasis is on facilitating getting results from models; forthis purpose graphic techniques supplement the mathematical formulas..
