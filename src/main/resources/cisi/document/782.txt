  A new estimate of the number of currently published scientific andtechnical periodicals has been put forward by K.P. Barr of the NationalLending Library.  It may be of interest to supplement this with some figureson the number and distribution of articles within these periodicals.  Thesefigures are derived from a survey undertaken at the NLL early in 1964.
