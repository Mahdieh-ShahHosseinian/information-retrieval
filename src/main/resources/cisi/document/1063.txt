                The title of this book is intended to indicatethat its scope is limited to manuscripts of the seventeenth centuryto the present.  Examples and techniques are drawn from institutionsin the United States with occasional references to practices in GreatBritain and Canada.  The book is directed toward the novice curatorof manuscripts, and, again, as the title indicates, it is intended to serve as a practical guide, not as an exposition of theory.
