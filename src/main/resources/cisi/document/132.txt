The way in which scientists and engineers make use of the informationsystems at their disposal, the demands that they put to them, thesatisfaction achieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on theirfurther work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wiseplanning of science information systems and policy.  Besides, thesematters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interestedin human organization and communication.  While "user studies" havenot yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical researchon the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  Forthis first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies thatmade their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give thereader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of researchhas witnessed progress along the following lines:    Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application  of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in  this field earlier in less rigorous forms;    The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution  development records; comparison of research teams working on identical  tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before;   and    An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the  information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American  Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research  in this area.
