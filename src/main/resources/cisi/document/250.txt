    This is the final report of the Colorado AcademicLibraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC)project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effortto establish a centralized acquisition and processingcenter.  The report of Phase I-II, completedin June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibilitystudy, the design of the central system, costsof acquiring and processing in nine libraries and anumber of related concerns such as accounting, thecongruence of approval plans and user attitudes towardlibrary services.    This report focuses on the experimental operationswhich were concluded officially on September 30,1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with thetheory and principles upon which a system mightbe based, we are presently concerned with thepragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved.    Although this report deals primarily withcooperative acquisitions and processing, we believeit also contributes to a better understanding ofcooperative programs.  The experiment was designedto monitor operations throughout the acquisition/cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurementswere made on most internal and external aspectsof the system.  Monitoring also extended intothe participating libraries where a productacceptance study was conducted.  A secondaryobjective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participantsand the central agency, such as the interface ofsystems and the human interaction of participantsand the Center.
