  The destructive effects of air pollution in the modern city uponthe health of its people, its trees, and its gardens, even its buildingsand statues, are well known and are being increasingly foughtagainst.  But the public, generally, and even many librariansand book-collectors, who should know better, are apparently unawareof the rapid deterioration of the world's libraries under theseconditions.  In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive careis regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silverand brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves aregiven no more attention than an occasional dusting which abradesthe books more than it protects them.  I would judge that more than90 percent of the books and documents that come to my binderyfor repair or restoration are in a condition that could have beenavoided by regular and appropriate preventive care.  Unfortunately,even when the custodians of books become aware of the problem,they my be handicapped by the relative unavailability of expertadvice on what procedures to follow in conserving their libraries.The present essay is intended to meet this need.
