   A computerized serials record and control system developed in 1968/69 for theTechnical Information Department of Pfizer Inc. is described and subjected to a cost analysis.. This cost analysis is conducted in the context of an investmentdecision, using the concept of net present value, a method not previously used in library literature.. The cost analysis reveals a positive net present valueand a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economicallyjustifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial andperiodical titles).. It may be that the break-even point in terms of collectionsize required for successful automation of serial records is smaller than has been assumed to date..
