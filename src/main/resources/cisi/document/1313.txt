For Popper, science is the very epitome of objective knowledge.  The centralpapers of his latest book argue and elaborate on this theme.  He says:  All work in science is work directed towards the growth of objectiveknowledge.  We are workers who are adding to the growth of objectiveknowledge as masons work on a cathedral.  I will first make some preliminary points about the word 'objective'.This will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming toorarefied.  Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third,I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach isseriously misleading.  I will propose a formula for systematically transformingPopper's theses and exposing what is important in them.  This 'transformativemethod' points the way towards an entirely different conception of what makesknowledge objective.
