   The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections andretrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machinesearching and automatic classification.. The former approach has beenfavored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive fornew methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble thoseof traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has beenthriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed..   The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treatedat considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support thehypothesis that classification quality improves as more information abouteach document is used for input to the classification program.. Sixnonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computerruns in which the number of words per document is increased progressivelyfrom 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, andtwo point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to therange of one through eight words per document..   Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practicalproblems to be faced are outlined..
