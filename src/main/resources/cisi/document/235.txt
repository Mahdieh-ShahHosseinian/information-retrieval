  In the intervening years since the appearance of thefirst collection of papers concerning book catalogs (Kingery,Robert E., and Tauber, Maurice F., Book Catalogs, N.Y.,The Scarecrow Press, 1963), attention has been concentratedon the book catalog as a substitute for, or an auxiliaryto the card catalog.  This selection of papers has identified some of theefforts to solve particular problems concerned with bookcatalogs.  The published papers, as well as those whichhave been written specifically for this volume, bring additionalobservations concerning the place of the book catalog inlibrary services.
