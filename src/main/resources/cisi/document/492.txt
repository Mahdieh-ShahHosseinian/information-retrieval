  The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user withcitations relevant to his query.  Since the user is the only person competentto make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that theselection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrievalerror.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measuresof performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of thesystem to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failureto retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It isdifficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage inbeing provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view,therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is adeficient system.
