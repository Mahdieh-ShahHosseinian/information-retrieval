  The NOAA/ERL library in Boulder, Colorado, performed a sample of sixliterature searches in an effort to gain management support forsearches prior to launching research projects.  It was found that manualsearches are very time consuming  and, in our opinion, can better bedone by persons with subject background. The machine searches furnished a higher percentage of unrelated materials. However, little staff time is requiredto obtain them.  Lacking qualified persons to do literature searches,either in the library or in the research groups, greater use should be made of the available computerized searches.
