  In 1966, AIP had a modest program in physics information supported by theNational Science Foundation.  The program went back several years, andAIP was considering a major expansion. The first task faced in such anexpansion was to augment the staff so as to be interdisciplinary in physics,computer operations and scientific information.  The staff would be ableto analyze and extend the studies made at AIP and elsewhere, and would formulate a basic approach.
