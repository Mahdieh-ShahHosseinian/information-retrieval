    Formal and informal scientific communication are complementary;they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that,perhaps, certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printedword, the library, and the mechanized search-and-retrieval system,whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of word-of-mouth andthe telephone.  The much more typical event is one in which the receiptof a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these twokinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientistas a receiver of information and the channel that brings him thatinformation usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it thatmay be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transactionand to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happenagain with similar results.
