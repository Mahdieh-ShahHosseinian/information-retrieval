  At the IFLA Liverpool Conference in 1971 a Joint workingGroup of the Committees on Cataloguing and on Serial Publicationswas set up to draw up an International Standard BibliographicDescription for Serials, taking the ISBD(M) as a model inso far as practicable.  As might be expected, the special problemspresented by serial publications made the task of developing anISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Grouptackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive draftswere prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L.Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier.  Probably no data element presented such a severe problem asthat of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen,Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  Asolution to this problem was found in the adoption of a devicewhich consisted of marrying the author statement to the generictitle proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen-space and dubbing the happy couple the "distinctive title."
