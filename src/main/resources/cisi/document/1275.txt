  The present investigation deals with the serialliterature of geology, including mineralogy.  SixAmerican journals for 1929 were chosen, and thereferences tabulated.  In Table I are listed thesesource journals, together with the total number ofpages of the actual articles studied, the total numberof citations in each journal, the number of referencesto books and to personal communications, and the nettotal, which represents the citations to serialliterature.  It is these last mentioned referenceswhich will be considered in further detail.  Thetotals are probably slightly high, due to unintentionalcounting in single articles of repetitions of the samecitation.
