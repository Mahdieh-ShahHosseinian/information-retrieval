  This paper analyses the formation of a new discipline, molecular biology,from the development of phage work.  It argues that such social variablesas the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities ordisciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explainphage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Eventhough persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decidedto enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even thoughsome recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficientto account for the development of the specialty, particularly given thecompetitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecularbiology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position,adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergenceof experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology andphilosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities whichoccur in scientific development.
