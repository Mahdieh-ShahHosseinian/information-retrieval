    The motivation for this investigation derived from aseries of visits to institutions which were deeply committedto the design, development, and operation of non-traditionalautomated information systems.  At the time of the visits,the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically,they did not appear to have made a significant impact on therespective user communities.  Although few people associatedwith the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbalindicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous.Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of timeand money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate.
