  According to a National Hospital Panel Survey conducted by the AmericanHospital Association in February 1970, 4,191 (72 percent) of the 5,820community hospitals in the United States operated a library.  This percentagefalls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100-bed capacity are considered(1,990 libraries in 3,318 hospitals).  In the 4,191 libraries, one or morefull-time staff members were found in only 1,054 (25 percent).  In evenfewer, 928, was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian.Clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to performproperly their functions of health education and patient care.  By "community hospital" we mean the nonfederal, short-term hospitalproviding general and selected special services, the hospital located at somedistance from a large medical center and without teaching and researchprograms, such as a nursing school or internships.  Though the librariansof more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the studyof this book, it is written primarily for an audience of untrained, probablynewly employed, individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital'slibrary and do not know where to begin.
