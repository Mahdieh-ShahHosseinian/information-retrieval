  Library operations in recent times have been characterized by a greatincrease in complexity.  The rapid expansion of collections, both in sizeand scope, the great variety of forms taken by items that now must be housedin the library, and the growth in expectations among library users areamong the factors that have contributed to this complexity.  In this setting,managerial decision making in the library has become an unenviably difficult task. Furthermore, the new technologies and new techniques which offer greatopportunities for library planners and  managers make even more difficult the use of traditional, intuitive approaches.  It is reasonable to ask whether techniques such as Operations Research (O. R.) that have proved valuable in similar situations for business and government, might not also be of service in libraries.
