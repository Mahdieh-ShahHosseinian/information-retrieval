  Information-use studies are vitally necessary in order to complement,challenge, and sharpen informed intuitive judgements, but even thebroadest conclusions drawn from such studies need to be examined critically.The conclusions or their generality may sometimes be invalidated by specialconditions in the survey sample, by the environment having been disturbed by the survey, by the interpretation given to questions or observations, orby the way the data has been analyzed.	These same factors make directcomparison of results from different surveys difficult, and make superficialcomparisons misleading.  Some comparisons and conclusions are certainly muchless sound than the casual reader might suppose, particularly when resultshave been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey.The difficulty of comparing information-use surveys is well illustrated bythe copious footnotes used by Menzel, Lieberman, and Dulchin in order toqualify the significance of the results which they compare.
