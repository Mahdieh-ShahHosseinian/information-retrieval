  After a synopsis of the relations existing between descriptors and their concepts, the EPD-program called "GENTHES" is described.  The program supportsthe construction of a thesaurus and its use.  The relational system correspondsto ISO/DIS 2788 (UNESCO) and DIN 1463.  It differentiates, however, in additiongenerically related and contiguous terms pertaining to a part-whole system.Characteristics that determine narrower terms against their broader terms areintroduced as new relation.  Many types of associations are made available forexperimenting.  The programmed generation of dependent relations reduces theamount of work to one third although ensuring total avoidance of formal errorsand logical contradictions, even in applying permitted polyhierarchy.  Theprogram is available in batch mode or in an interactive timesharing version(Remote GENTHES).  The program functions are input, logical and formal inputchecking, generation of relations, display, delete, print on line printer andstorage on disk.  GENTHES is running in Vienna on a System IBM/370.
