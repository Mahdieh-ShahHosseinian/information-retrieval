  The selection of papers published here explores activities in whichindefinite neglect of either aspect, the conceptual or the mechanical,will lead to practical and theoretical disaster.  They centre on therecovery of records according to their subject matter.  Since libraries began, librarians have evolved, studied, and taughtprocedures for indexing and classifying.  These allow some delegationfrom subject specialists who understand the subject matter, tolibrary staff who can recognize the ways in which specialists talkabout it.  The procedures consider mostly only the interpretationof texts, not the text itself as an object with recognizable markssubject to the laws of physics and the principles of engineering.They assume the problems of topic identification solved, and themethods for recovering physical texts as independent of the methodsfor describing the interpretations of texts.
