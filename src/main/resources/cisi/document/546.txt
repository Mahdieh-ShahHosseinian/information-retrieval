    On the 14th and 15th of January, 1971, a Workshop on "The UserInterface for Interactive Search of Bibliographic Data Bases" was held atRicky's Hyatt House in Palo Alto, California.  The Workshop, sponsored bythe Information Systems committee of the American Federation ofInformation Processing Societies, brought together a group of informationscientists who have been directly involved with this subject area.  They wereprovided in advance with a "Challenge" paper and with a number of papersprepared in response to that challenge.  The Workshop sessions themselveswere devoted exclusively to focussed discussions of the material and of theproblems in and the prospects for more effective systems design of the userinterface.  The content of these two days of deliberation prompted makingthe substance of the Workshop experience available to a larger audience.This book is intended to accomplish that goal.
