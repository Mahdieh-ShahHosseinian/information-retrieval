   The author gives a general definition of the IR thesaurus and outlines its inner structure.. He describes a procedure of accumulating the body of keywords which is required to compile the vocabulary of descriptors.. An attempt is madeto determine how the rate of keyword accumulation depends on the number of abstracts' titles processed and in what way the volume of descriptor vocabularyis related to the number of documents indexed.. General rules are given for lexicographic processing of the keywords accumulated and for compiling of thedescriptor vocabulary.. The algorithm has been constructed which is designed to generate the article of each descriptor in the thesaurus.. To construct thisalgorithm the author analyzed the results of word-association tests and selected 5 most important types of paradigmatic relations.. He formulates the basic rules for translation of the texts describing the main subject content ofthe documents and of the users' requests from a natural language into the IRlanguage of descriptors.. (The block diagram of algorithm for translation ofthese texts is also given..) In conclusion the author describes generalprinciples of lexicographic editing of the above mentioned texts..
