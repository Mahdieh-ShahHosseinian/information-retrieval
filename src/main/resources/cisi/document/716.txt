  Most discussions about the future design of chemical information systemsemphasize the effects of computer speed on composition, storage, searching,and retrieval.  Little attention has been paid to the behavior of thescientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literaturein that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behaviorand thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion thatthe literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  Whatseems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that thenew and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and thatthe system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selectivecompression.
