  This book is intended as an exploratory sketch of a revolutionaryscientific perspective and conceptual framework as it might be appliedto the sociocultural system.  This point of view and still developingframework, as interpreted here, stems from the General Systems Researchmovement and the now closely allied fields of cybernetics and informationor communication theory.  The principal goal of the book is to bring to theattention of a larger number of social scientists, particularly sociologists,the wealth of principles, ideas, and insights that have already brought ahigher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas ofbiology, psychology, and some physical sciences to say nothing of theapplied areas of technology to which they are essential.
