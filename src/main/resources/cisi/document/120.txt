  In corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening ofcontent coverage.  The initial emphasis was on design andevaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely -  and narrowly - connected with information storage and retrievalsystems.  It is becoming increasingly clear, however, thatthere are many activities and ideas outside of this contextthat have, or can have, a very important bearing on the workof systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working onlibrary and documentation systems.  This chapter attemptsto continue enlarging our perception of the range of reportedactivities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in whichour readers are chiefly interested.
