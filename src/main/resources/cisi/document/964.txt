       The information demands, or information needs, of current scientificresearch are similar in many respects to the information needs inother forms of scholarship.  But this is not true in all cases, and the focus of this paper is on the needs of the research scientists.  In discussing theinformation needs of the scientist, I shall not limit myself to those forwhich library work is immediately relevant; in fact, a good part of thispaper will call attention to the importance of those aspects of scientificcommunication that take place outside libraries and, indeed, outside literature. (There are, of course, very few aspects of scientific communication to which library work is not at least indirectly relevant.)
