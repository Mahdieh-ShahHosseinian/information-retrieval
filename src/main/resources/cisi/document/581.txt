   A computer program for automatic identification of "full form" casecitations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall. 220,18 L. Ed. 343; Southland Industries, Inc. v. Federal CommunicationsCommission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developedby this group and is now operational..    The level of performance of this program known as "The CitationIdentifier" is high.. In a recent computer run, The CitationIdentifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisionsof U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227(that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and threefalse drops occurred..   Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) wereidentified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identificationscontaining two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which somecitation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program ("short hits");and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly includedin the citations ("long hits").   Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible andcan be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program..   The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run,the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of textwas approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increasedby suitable changes in the computer program..   An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g.,"the Geddes decision", "the Southland Industries case") is now in preparation..
