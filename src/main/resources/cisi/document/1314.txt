  This work is concerned with the influence of scientific colleagues on theconduct of one another's research.  With few exceptions, the discussion islimited to basic research in experimental sciences with well-establishedtheories.  In this type of research, the scientific community is relativelyautonomous, and the group of colleagues is the most important source ofsocial influence on research.  Colleagues influence decisions to selectproblems and techniques, to publish results, and to accept theories.
