  This is the second book based on studies into social aspects of book reading.  The present book is largely a report on work which wascarried out in 1967-68 but either not analysed or writtenup in time for the first book, or work actually carried outand analysed during the second year's research.  The readerof this book will find it useful to have read the first book,but the present book is self-contained and does not requirereference to the first one.
