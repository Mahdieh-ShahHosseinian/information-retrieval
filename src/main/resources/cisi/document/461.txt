    The present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflectthe fact that the reader of today's book is much more likely to be aninterested college student with a great awareness of the current informationrevolution than was the case ten years ago.  Thus, hardware, materials, andprocesses used in connection with information systems are discussed first,in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per sebegins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, thesechapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 bookwhich adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplifiedconcept of an information system and its components, and paves the way fordiscussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especiallyfor data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and userstudies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that havedeveloped strongly since 1963.
