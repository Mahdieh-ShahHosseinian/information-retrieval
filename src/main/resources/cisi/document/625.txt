   It is argued that a user's subjective evaluation of the personalutility of a retrieval system's output to him, if it could be properlyquantified, would be a near-ideal measure of retrieval effectiveness..A hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility bymeans of an elicitation procedure.. Because the hypothetical methodologyis impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlyingsimplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifyingassumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure..This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certainkind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measureof effectiveness to use under given test conditions..
