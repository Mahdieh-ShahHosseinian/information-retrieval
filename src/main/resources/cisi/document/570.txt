  We discuss how alternative methods of automaticterm clustering may provide insight into how terms arerelated within a corpus.  The work reported uses acorpus of 2267 documents that contain 3950 indexterms.	A similarity matrix is developed using thedocument - term matrix.  A threshold level T is applied tothe similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that aregreater than or equal to the threshold level are setequal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero.  Three definitions are applied to the correspondinggraph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters.These are, (1) the connected components of the graph,(2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and(3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of thegraph as described that show how insight may begained into the term relations by varying the thresholdlevels and the cluster definitions.
