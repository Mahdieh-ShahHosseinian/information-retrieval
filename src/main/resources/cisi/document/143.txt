  It is the intent of this volume to develop a model designedto eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities andto improve administrative procedures for future developmentof area programs.  This will be accomplished by givingsome indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialistbibliographers and by isolating factors which influencethese opinions.  These attitudes will be presented by theperceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and theexpectations of faculty and library administrators toward thatrole.  The bibliographer's academic, professional, andeducational experience will be examined in this framework.
