   Substantial degrees of compression of bibliographical data bases result fromthe application to them a modified form of run-length coding.. The methodinvolves attenuation of the zero:one bit ratio of the data base.. This can be achieved by substitution of codes with the highest zero:one ratios the mostfrequent symbols, or by substitution of 2-bytes codes for diagrams.. A form ofrun-length coding in which the run-length is represented as a fixed-lengthbinary number is then applied..
