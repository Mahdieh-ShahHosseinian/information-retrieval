   The model of a technical information system described there by Dr. Kessler involves a working literature taken from twenty-one journals in the field ofphysics.. The system, designed and constructed at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology as a prototype operating in a realistic test environment, uses remote consoles having access to a time-sharing computer facility.. Programshave been developed for a large variety of search and processing techniques inreal time as well as for delayed output.. The work is supported by the NationalScience Foundation and in part by Project MAC, the experimental computer facility at MIT which is sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency..
