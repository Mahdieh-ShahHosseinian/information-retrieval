    The development of the separately housed undergraduate library on themodern university campus is a recent innovation - so recent, in fact, thatin September, 1965, there were only six such libraries in the United States.The interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creationof these libraries, however, is not of such recent origin.  As early as 1608,when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley's Library, "he proposed theestablishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student.  ButSir Thomas Bodley was opposed."  So it is to Harvard that we turn for an example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate's plight.    Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities andtheir libraries were relatively small until this century.  More important,they were largely undergraduate institutions.  The great expansion ofgraduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon.  The problems of theundergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded bythe striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasison the acquisition of materials suitable for research.    The large university collections became increasingly difficult for theundergraduate to use.  When he had to select his books from the card catalogand obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might wellabandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out,missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes.  Theuniversity library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - studyconditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle thevolume of work.
