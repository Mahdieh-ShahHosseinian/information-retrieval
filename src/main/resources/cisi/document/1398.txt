  This study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense(as opposed to semantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed tophonemics and morphology).  It forms part of an attempt to constructa formalized general theory of linguistic structure and toexplore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorousformulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation thanmere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-establishedmethods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed modelsfor linguistic structure can play an important role, both negativeand positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precisebut inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we canoften expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently,gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively,a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for manyproblems other than those for which it was explicitly designed.Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurdconclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail tobe useful in two important respects.
