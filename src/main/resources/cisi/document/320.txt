  The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a programdesigned to be capable of being taught to "comprehend"English text.  When text which the program has not seen beforeis input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relatingeach (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a largememory.  This memory is a "semantic network" representingfactual assertions about the world.  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memorywhich have been found to relate to the new text, adaptingand combining these copies to represent the meaning of thenew text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the programsuccessfully comprehends is encoded into the same format asthat of the memory.  In this form it can be added into thememory.  Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilitiesfor correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are tobe taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presentlycontains a relatively small number of examples of suchassertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations forexpressing either of these are provided.  Thus the programnow corresponds to a general process for comprehendinglanguage, and it provides a methodology for adding theadditional information this process requires to actuallycomprehend text of any particular kind.  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLCallow new factual assertions and capabilities for relatingtext to such stored assertions and capabilities for relatingtext to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into thesystem, it becomes available to help comprehend a great manyother sentences in the future.
