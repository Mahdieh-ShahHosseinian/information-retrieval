  Many methods for the coding of chemical structures have been described in the literature.	Some methods codethe compound only partially; typical of these are themethods using descriptor codes.  Other methods, amongwhich the so-called ciphers are prominent, codecompounds exhaustively.  All these methods requirecerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must have learned the rules of the code, and who must known howto dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  Adisadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore,that they are not generally understood by chemists.  Noadvantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how togenerate and how to interpret a chemical code.	Codes areneeded only for the mechanical manipulation of chemicalstructures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compoundscould be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion wouldrelieve the chemist of considerable burden.
