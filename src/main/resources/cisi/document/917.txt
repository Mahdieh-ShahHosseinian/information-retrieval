  The book was built on interviews with the Library's middlemanagers, on discussions with working specialists in thevarious divisions, on conversations with and questionnairessent to out-of-Library users, and from my own observationsthrough almost twenty-five years in the Library's CongressionalResearch Service.  After the text was completed, it was readby appropriate people in each department for factual contentand ultimately by the staff in the Librarian's Office fortheir comment.  At no point was there pressure to change textor conclusions - although there were plenty of good-naturedsuggestions on details, and nearly everyone urged a fullerdescription of his own particular specialty!
