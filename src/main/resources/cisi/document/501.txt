  A thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in informationstorage and retrieval systems.  Three parts of this definition need further elaboration:  1. A vocabulary is a collection of terms.  2. The structure of a vocabulary can be described as a set of relationships     between terms.  3. Utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of     rules which take into account the characteristics of the system.
