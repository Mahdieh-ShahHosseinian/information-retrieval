  This textbook grew out of some discussions between the authorsabout the interdisciplinary character of the field of information storageand retrieval.  We both felt that the need existed to show whateach professional group concerned with the solution of informationstorage and retrieval problems could contribute.  A university-levelcourse was developed, based on the concept that each person shouldbe made aware of how others could help him.  The course was presentedabout a dozen times over the ensuing years, and this book is based on it.
