  In the present edition we have, to a far greater extent, integrated diffusionresearch with the scientific study of human communication.  Diffusionresearchers have long been aware that they were investigating a special typeof communication behavior.  In this book we stress communication conceptsand frameworks in our analysis of the diffusion process.  We feel this providesan advantage of conceptual clarity as well as ease of wide expression.  Ouradoption of the communication viewpoint is reflected in the addition ofseveral chapters, the complete reorganization of all chapters, and the frequentinclusion of new concepts.
