   Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrievalpurposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematicexperiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestionshave been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatickeyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classificationsshould have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments weshowed that some forms of classification could give good results, and thispaper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort ofclassification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum formsof classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and thatdefinite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classificationfor collections like the test one: the best results are given when groupingis confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexingterms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keywordfrequency..
