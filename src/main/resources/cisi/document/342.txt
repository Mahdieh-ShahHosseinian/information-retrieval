  This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis themain problems related to corporate headings, the difficultiesraised by them and the solutions which now prevail in variouscountries.  In order to make the differences existing between the varioussolutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many ofthem more evident, a great number of examples in a variety oflanguages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examplesare also intended to draw attention to differences existing withregard to various technical details, such as punctuation, capitalization, transliteration, etc.  In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove thatcertain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for onecountry or one language would not satisfy the requirements ofanother country or another language.  In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been complemented by references to professional literature on the subjectavailable to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressedthere.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguingpractices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users'approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciatedthat, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search forcorporate headings present more problems than any other type ofheading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has asyet paid insufficient attention to these problems.
