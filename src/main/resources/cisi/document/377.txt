  Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of acollection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of themore traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexingis that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlookedin a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexingmethods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore,citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms usedin subject indexes.
