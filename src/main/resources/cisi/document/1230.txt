  Even while Edition 2 was under preparation, seeds had beensown to take the study of the Theory of Classification to a deeperlevel with the co-operation of a wider circle of workers.  AnInternational Conference of Libraries and Documentation Centres washeld in Brussels from 11 to 18 September 1955.  During the Conference,a whole forenoon was devoted to a Group Meeting on "Classification,General and Special", under my Chairmanship.  The following tworesolutions recommended by the Group Meeting were adopted by thePlenary Meeting on 16 September 1955.  "1 The FID recommends that a deeper and more extensive study should be made of the general theory of classification, includingfacet analysis, and also of their application in the documentationof specific subjects.  "2 The Commission proposes, that in liaison with the FID/CACommittee, a permanent Working Group be created in order to makemutual exchange of theoreticians' experiences and points of viewpossible.  The rapporteurs shall bring about the creation of such agroup and furnish the information and means of work in order thatpractical results may be obtained in the shortest time, by makingmail exchanges easier and more frequent.  The scheme proposed by Dr.Ranganathan will serve as the basic document" [154].  Further,at its meeting held on 16 September 1955, the Council of FID requestedits Bureau to convene an International Seminar on Classification.This was in accord with the memorandum prepared by me at the requestof Donker Duyvis [133].
