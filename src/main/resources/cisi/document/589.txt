   The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes andtheir numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titlesfor their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services,such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, butalso in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, suchas bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titlesof chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors becomeincreasingly aware of the importance of titles as "carriers" of information..The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papersare becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemicalpapers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958..   The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive wordsin the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leadingsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of athesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leadingsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use ofa thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count ofshort titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958,and 1968..   Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers arebeing eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informativesince the advent of the KWIC index..
