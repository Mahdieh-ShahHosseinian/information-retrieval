  This paper examines the implications of the findings of evaluative testsregarding the retrieval performance of natural language in various subjectfields.  It suggests parallel investigations into the structure of naturallanguage, with particular reference to terminology, as used in the differentbranches of basic science.  The criteria for defining the terminologicalconsistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested fordetermining the degree of terminological consistency.  The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines suchas, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances inwhich terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientificcommunity to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines -are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificiallycreated scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with currentdevelopments and thus points to the source of natural language.
