  This book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theoryand makes explicit its relationship to automata.  The book begins with anexplanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  Thefundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well asits three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitivegrammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topicsas normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types ofautomata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  Theseautomata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linearbounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered indetail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludeswith certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties,computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars,stack automata, and decidability.
