  This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents forscreening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having thegreatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance ofthe document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentencesignificance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words),the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmaticwords (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentencelocation).  The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology.The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence ofthe above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures forthe compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the controlparameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts withmanually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposedcomponents dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts.  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentence selection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words,key words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, researchmethodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation.
