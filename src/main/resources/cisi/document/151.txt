  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientificand Technical Information and the end product of the completeresearch will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel researchin the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School ofBusiness Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in theconstruction of a faceted classification scheme for management,this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizingfaceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.  A study of existing information retrieval systems in themanagement field has already been made, so a decision to adoptsome form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparativestudy of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has alsoalready been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfieldresults that appear to provide evidence of the superiority ofnatural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarilybecause these results were restricted to tests on an aeronauticalcollection, and it may well be that the natural language of thisdiscipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which iscertainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language ofmanagement.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, whoquotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organicchemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and socialscience (20 per cent).  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipmentavailable to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.
