   Relatively few studies have been concerned with the use of biomedicalbooks.. This paper reports an investigation into use made of library booksby biomedical investigators.. Based on cancelled charge slips collected at theYale Medical Library circulation desk, telephone appointments were made tointerview those research investigators whose books has been returned theprevious day.. The interviewer obtained answers from the investigator to aquestionnaire to discover how the investigator had learned of a book, if thebook had been useful, and, if useful, how it had been used.. During the six-month study period, 30.4 percent of researchers' volumes returned weremonographs.. Almost four-fifths of books borrowed supplied information wanted,and about four-fifths of books used had been printed in the previous decade..Nine-tenths of the use of books was research-related, the other tenth beingfor lecture preparation..
