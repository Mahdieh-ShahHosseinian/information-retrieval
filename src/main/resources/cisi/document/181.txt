  At the June 1962 Convention of the Medical Library Association inChicago, Illinois, Mr. Stanley Truelson, now Librarian of the University ofRochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, circulated a petitionrequesting the collection and publication of medical school librarystatistics.  Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed thepetition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group ofthe Medical Library Association.  This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself,studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Officeof Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of ourspecialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminologyin the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitionsfor Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961).  After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by thecommittee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the UnitedStates and Canada.  The Canadian medical school libraries were includedas a result of communications with Miss Doreen Fraser, Librarian of theBio-Medical Library of the University of British Columbia and Dr. J.Wendell McLeod of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges.
