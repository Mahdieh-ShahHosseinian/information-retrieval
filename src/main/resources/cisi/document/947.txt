  The research project which produced this book concentrated on the problemof the design and development of statistical information systems that wouldprovide quantitative information for effective management of university andlarge public libraries.  Since there is an inseparable need not only forimproved library statistical data systems but also for the above-mentionedframeworks for rational planning and decision making, we have devotedconsiderable effort to the development of analytical models that might assistlibrary administrators in making decisions that would maximize the flow ofbenefits imparted to the communities the library serves.  Some of the results ofthis model-building effort are repored in these pages.
