    Models and techniques to aid management in planningcontrolling R&D projects frequently use subjective probability ofsuccess forecasts as one of the major inputs.  An experiment wasconducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company tomeasure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts.The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certaintypes of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shapeof polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of successforecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators thanseveral commonly used project status measures.  These results tendto support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models thatare based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be usedby management to aid in early identification of eventually failingprojects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding.
