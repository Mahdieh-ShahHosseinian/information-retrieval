  The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians inresolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  Theintent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methodsavailable for the application of modern data processing to library operations.For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool toguide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniquesinto his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating himnot only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summaryof the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives andthe technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and,particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determiningthe choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always inthe context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems,as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of goodmanagement, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims toeducate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problemsof applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork hasalready been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried outanalyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and isdeveloping better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues aprocess that is already underway.
