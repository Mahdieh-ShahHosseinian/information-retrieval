   This collection attempts to bring together a readable and germane group ofmaterials ranging from history, review papers, and practical exposition toreports on current research and development and conjecture about the future.. It is expected that these selections will be of interest and use to the teacher and student.. It is also hoped that they will be of equal interest tothe professional librarian and researcher.. There has been a deliberate attemptto exclude materials that have appeared in recently published collections..It is for this reason that the names of Panizzi, Cutter, Martel, Hanson,Dewey, Rider, Bliss, Haykin, Shera, Lubetzky and others do not appear.. Aspecific focus has been given to this book.. It is in the direction of a rational sharing of local, national, and international efforts and the eventual coordination and standardization of practices in the technical servicesinsofar as this is practical..
