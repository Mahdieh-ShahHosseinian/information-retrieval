  The plan of the following Classification and Index was developed early in1873.  It was the result of several months' study of library economy as foundin some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits tovarious American libraries.  In this study, the author became convinced thatthe usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additionalexpenditure.  Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads himto believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to thisincreased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other methodwhich he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing andindexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable fornumbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves.
