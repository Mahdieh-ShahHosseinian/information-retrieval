  Work and the Nature of Man is the third book of atrilogy concerning job attitudes.  In the first book,Job Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion, mycolleagues and I attempted to review and systematizewhat had been gleaned from research and contemplationafter a half-century of effort.  In the Motivation toWork that followed, we described an original researchstudy that offered a completely new hypothesis about theway people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I havetaken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theoryof Work and the Nature of Man.	While the trilogy containsthe three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledgeof what has gone before, new research and finally atheory, the task that I set out for myself many yearsago, upon graduation for the School of Public Healthat the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning.  That task was to give original substance to the new discipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible,to make some positive contributions.
