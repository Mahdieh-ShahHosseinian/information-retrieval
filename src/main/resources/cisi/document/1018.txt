  The concept of the core collection in a large library is not new. Thethought behind such a concept is to provide a separation of the morefrequently used volumes from those that are infrequently used.  Therehave been, however, difficulties in determining what volumes are to beincluded within the core collection.  It is usually necessary to establisha committee or group of professional people who determine, usually by enumeration, those volumes that should be included in the core collection.Often the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions ofthe individuals, and although valid in many cases as desirable reading, thecore collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements.
