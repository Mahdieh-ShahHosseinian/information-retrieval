    Decision Support Systems (DSS) represent a concept of the role ofcomputers within the decision making process.  The term has become arallying cry for researchers, practitioners, and managers concerned thatManagement Science and Management Information Systems fields have becomeunnecessarily narrow in focus.  As with many rallying cries, the term isnot well defined.  For some writers, DSS simply mean interactive systemsfor use by managers.  To others, the key issue is support, rather thansystem.  They focus on understanding and improving the decision process;a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Someresearchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as anextension of Management Science techniques.  The former define DecisionSupport as providing managers with access to data and the latter as givingthem access to analytic models.    The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant tosituations where a "final" system can be developed only through anadaptive process of learning and evolution.  The design strategy mustthen focus on getting finished; this is very different from ManagementScience and Data Processing approaches.  The research issued for DSScenter around adaption and evolution; they include managerial learningrepresentation of tasks and user behavior, design architecture andstrategies for getting started.
