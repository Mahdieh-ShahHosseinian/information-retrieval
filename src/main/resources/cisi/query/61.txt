    The way that individuals construct and modify search queries on alarge interactive document retrieval system is subject to systematic biasessimilar to those that have been demonstrated in experiments on judgementsunder uncertainty.  These biases are shared by both naive and sophisticatedsubjects and cause the inquirer searching for documents on a large interactivesystem to construct and modify queries inefficiently.  A searching algorithmis suggested that helps the inquirer to avoid the effect of these biases.
