    A prototype system is created that integrates a microfiche cataloginto an online computer system for bibliographic control.  Costs andoperational data are collected and analyzed.  The system permits the moreeconomical microfiche storage of catalog records than would be feasiblefor comparable online magnetic disk storage.  Experimental testsdemonstrate the feasibility of the online microfiche catalog system for usein library technical services and retrieval of bibliographic data.  Theprimary result of the project is the creation of a completely operationalfacility, including all equipment, software, procedures, and data basesnecessary to demonstrate the system.  A second set of results is derivedfrom the experimental use of the system and the evaluation of costs andtimes for various operations.  The cost effectiveness of the online microfichecatalog is demonstrated.
