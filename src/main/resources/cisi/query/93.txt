    A method of iterative searching, using the results of one iteration searchto formulate the next iteration search, was applied to a full-text databaseconsisting of some 2400 documents and 1,3000,000 text-words of Hebrew andAramaic.  The iterative method consists of clustering the documents returnedin an iteration, using weighting by proximity and by frequency simultaneously.The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in thecontext of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonymsvia manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iterationsearch.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earliersmall-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrastto global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to smalldatabases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to bewell suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recallsimultaneously.  Further experiments using more test-queries run on evenlarger databases should be made to collect further evidence as to theperformance of these methods.
