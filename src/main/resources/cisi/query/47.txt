Is there any established means at present for an international exchangeof material about information retrieval?  If there is, does it takethe form of an international agency or center which regularlydistributes information retrieval methods and research results?  Ifthere is not, in what ways has this material crossed nationalboundaries?  What seem to have been some of the problems blocking abetter international exchange, and is any effort being made to solvesome of those problems?
