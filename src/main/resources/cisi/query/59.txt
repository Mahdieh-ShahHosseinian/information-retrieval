    The retrieval performance of book indexes can be measured in terms oftheir ability to direct a user selectively to text material whose identitybut not location is known.  The method requires human searchers to basetheir searching strategies on actual passages from the book rather than ontest queries, natural or contrived.  It circumvents the need for relevancejudgement, but still yields performance indicators that correspondapproximately to the recall and precision ratios of large document retrievalsystem evaluation.  A preliminary application of the method to the subjectindexing of two major encyclopedias showed one encyclopedia apparentlysuperior in both the finding and discrimination abilities of retrievalperformance.  The method is presently best suited for comparative testingsince its ability to yield absolute or reproducible measures is as yet notestablished.
