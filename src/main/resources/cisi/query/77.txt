    This paper presents a method of normalizations of English titles andtheir retrieval.  The title expressed by a noun phrase or a noun clauseis converted to a function-expression by parsing.  For the retrieval witha reasonable recall rate as well as a high precision rate, the function-expression is transformed to a predicate-governor form, and then normalizedto a standard form.  Therefrom, various items are extracted and recordedin a hierarchical tree-like inverted file.    In order to keep the recall rate in a reasonable value, severalretrieval stages are implemented based on the key-term and case-labelmatching.  The retrieval is controlled by the preciseness of the specificationof case-labels for each key-term.
