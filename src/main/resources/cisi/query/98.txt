    Online retrieval systems may be difficult to use, especially by endusers, because of heterogeneity and complexity.  Investigations have concernedthe concept of a translating computer interface as a means to simplify accessto, and operation of, heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems anddatabases.  The interface allows users to make requests in a common language.These requests are translated by the interface into the appropriate commandsfor whatever system is being interrogated.  System responses may also betransformed by the interface into a common form before being given to theusers.  Thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a single"virtual" system to the user.  The interface also provides instruction andother search aids for the user.  The philosophy, design, and implementationof an experimental interface named CONIT are described.
