    This paper discusses the origins of library networks and traces theirdevelopment in the United States in the late 1960s through the present.The concept of resource sharing, with particular attention to the inter-library loan and programs for the cooperative acquisition and storage ofmaterials, is examined in relationship to library networks.  In particular,attention is given to the question of how these two major components oflibrary cooperation, which have tended to be separate, might become moreclosely integrated.
