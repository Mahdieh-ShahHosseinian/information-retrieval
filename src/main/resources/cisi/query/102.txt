    The frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a collectionhave been used as indicators of term importance for content analysis andindexing purposes.  In particular, very rare or very frequent terms arenormally believed to be less effective than medium-frequency terms.  Recentlyautomatic indexing theories have been devised that use not only the termfrequency characteristics but also the relevance properties of the terms.The major term-weighting theories are first briefly reviewed.  The termprecision and term utility weights that are based on the occurrencecharacteristics of the terms in the relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant,documents of a collection are then introduced.  Methods are suggested forestimating the relevance properties of the terms based on their overalloccurrence characteristics in the collection.  Finally, experimentalevaluation results are shown comparing the weighting systems using the termrelevance properties with the more conventional frequency-based methodologies.
