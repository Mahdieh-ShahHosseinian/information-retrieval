    The evaluation of the concept of a translating compuyter interface forsimplifying operation of multiple, heterogenous online bibliographicretrieval systems has been undertaken.  An experimental retrieval system,named CONIT, was built and tested under controlled conditions withinexperienced end users.  A detailed analysis of the experimental usagesshowed that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently wellto find relevant document references.  Success was attributed, in part,to a simple command language, adequate online instruction, and a simplifiednatural-language, keyword/stem approach to searching.  It is concluded thatoperational interfaces of the type studied can provide for increased usabilityof existing system in a cost effective manner, especially for searchers.Furthermore, more advanced interfaces based on improved instruction andautomated search strategy techniques could further enhance retrievaleffectiveness for a wide class of users.
