    In this paper we describe a practical method of partial-match retrievalin very large data files.  A binary code word, called a descriptor, isassociated with each record of the file.  These record descriptors arethen used to form a derived descriptor for a block of several records,which will serve as an index for the block as a whole; hence, the name"indexed descriptor files."    First the structure of these files is described and a simple, efficientretrieval algorithm is presented.  Then its expected behavior, in terms ofstorage accesses, is analyzed in detail.  Two different file creationprocedures are sketched, and a number of ways in which the file organizationcan be "tuned" to a particular application is suggested.
