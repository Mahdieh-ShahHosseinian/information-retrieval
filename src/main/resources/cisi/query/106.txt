    A set of experiments was conducted to determine the suitability of theColon Classification as a foundation for the automated analysis, representationand retrieval of primary information from the full text of documents.  Primaryinformation is that information embodied in the text of a document, as opposedto secondary information which is generally in such forms as:  an abstract, atable of contents, or an index.    Full text databases were created in two subject areas and queries solicitedfrom specialists in each area.  An automated full text indexing system, alongwith four automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the variousfeatures of the Colon Classification.  Two Boolean-based systems and one simpleword occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval resultsagainst types of systems which are in more common use.  The systems' retrievalperformances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expectedsearch length reduction factors.    Overall, it was found that the Colon Classification-based systems did notperform significantly better than the other systems.
