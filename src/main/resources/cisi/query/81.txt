    The lexical problems in large information systems are created by thenecessity of handling a great number of names and their interrelations.Such lexical problems are not covered completely by the concept datadictionaries, which are mostly concerned with database scheme design ratherthan the execution of operations.  In this paper we introduce our view of alexical subsystem as a separate component in an information system architecture,to deal with linguistic and control functions concerning the lexical problemsin local and network environments.  The lexical suybsystem is a specialefficiently organized program package, which plays the role of a "linguisticfilter" in a broad sense for lexically incorrect queries, promotes integrationof databases and information retrieval systems, and facilitates the creationof local information systems.  We hope that lexical subsystems can becomeproductive for any large, especially distributed, information system.
