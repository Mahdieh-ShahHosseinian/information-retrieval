    Some of the automatic classification procedures used in informationretrieval derive clusters of documents from an intermediate similaritymatrix, the computation of which involves comparing each of the documentsin the collection with all of the others.  It has recently been suggestedthat many of these comparisons, specifically those between documentshaving no terms in common, may be avoided by means of the uyse of an invertedfile to the document collection.  This communication shows that theapproach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument comparisonsonly if the documents are each indexed by a limited number of indexingterms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many document pairs will be comparedseveral times over and the computation will be greater than whenconventional approaches are used to generate the similarity matrix.
