    A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary ofuser queries and the vocabulary of documents relevant to the queries, andthe value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval systemkeywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful.Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented atthe School of Library and Information Science, University of WesternOntario.  Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, astatistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrievaltests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Resultsshowed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, butindicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development andmaintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.
