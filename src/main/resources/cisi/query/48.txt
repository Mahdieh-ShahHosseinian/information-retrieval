Information retrieval is still such a new and experimental field that aline distinguishing research and practice is often difficult - evenimpossible - to draw.  Are there, however, actual centers of researchon information retrieval?  If so, in which countries are theylocated?  Who supports them - government, business, universities, orlibraries?  Can information retrieval as a specialized researchdiscipline be said to be emerging, or is it still an amalgam of skillsfrom other fields, such as mathematics, engineering, and libraryscience?  In other words, tell me about information retrieval research.
