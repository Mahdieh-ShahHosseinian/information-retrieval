    A new type of natural language parser is presented.  The idea behindthis parser is to map input sentences into the deepest form of therepresentation of their meaning and inferences, as is appropriate.  Theparser is not distinct from an entire understanding system.  It uses anintegrated conception of inferences, scripts, plans and other knowledge toaid in the parse.  Furthermore, it does not attempt to parse everything itsees.  Rather, it determines what is most interesting and concentrates onthat, ignoring the rest.
