    In 1978 Collier presented some hypothetical data on economic aspectsof the use of online services as compared with subscriptions to printedservices in libraries.  Collier's view of the economics of online searchingseems misleadingly pessimistic because:1.  It looks only at costs but not at effectiveness in comparing the two    modes of access and searching.  An analysis combining cost and    effectiveness aspects (i.e., a cost-effectiveness analysis) would    give a completely different picture.2.  The way the cost data are presented is grossly unfair to the online    mode of access and use.This work contains corrected information regarding online and printedservices in libraries.
