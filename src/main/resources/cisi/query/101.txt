    Conventional information retrieval processes are largely based on datamovement, pointer manipulations and integer arithmetic; more refined retrievalalgorithms may in addition benefit from substantial computational power.    In the present study a number of parallel processing methods are describedthat serve to enhance retrieval services.  In conventional retrievalenvironments parallel list processing and parallel search facilities are ofgreatest interest.  In more advanced systems, the use of array processorsalso proves beneficial.  Various information retrieval processes are examinedand evidence is given to demonstrate the usefulness of parallel processingand fast computational facilities in information retrieval.
