    From the detailed analysis of eight previously published mathematicalmodels, a general formulation of Bradford's distribution can be deduced asfollows:  y = a log(x + c) + b, where y is the ratio of the cumulativefrequency of articles to the total number of articles and x is the ratioof the rank of journals to the total number of journals.  The parameters a, b,and c are the slope, the intercept, and the shift in a straight line to log rank,respectively.  Each of the eight models is a special case of the generalformulation and is one of five types of formulation.  In order to estimatethree unknown parameters, a statistical method using root-weighted squareerror is proposed.  A comparative experiment using 11 databases suggests thatthe fifth type of formulation with three unknown parameters is the best fitto the observed data.  A further experiment shows that the deletion of thedroop data leads to a more accurate value of parameters and less error.
