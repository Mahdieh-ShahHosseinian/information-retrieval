    The use of document clusters has been suggested as an efficient fileorganization for a document retrieval system.  It is possible that byusing this information about the relationships between documents that theeffectiveness of the system (i.e., its ability to distinguish relevantfrom non-relevant documents) may also be improved.  In this paper aprobabilistic model of cluster searching  based on query classification isdescribed.  This model is tested with retrieval experiments which indicatethat it can be more effective than heuristic cluster searches and clustersearches based on other models.  It can also be more effective than a fullsearch in which every document is compared to the query.  The efficiencyaspects of the implementation of the model are discussed.
