    A new method is described to extract significant phrases in the titleand the abstreact of scientific or technical documents.  The method isbased upon a text structure analysis and uses a relatively small dictionary.The dictionary has been constructed based on the knowledge about conceptsin the field of science or technology and some lexical knowledge.  Forsignificant phrases and their component items may be used in differentmeanings among the fields.  A text analysius approach has been applied toselect significant phrases as substantial and semantic information carriersof the contents of the abstract.    The results of the experiment for five sets of documents have shownthat the significant phrases are effectively extracted in all cases, andthe number of them for every document and the processing time is fairlysatisfactory.  The information representation of the document, partlyusing the method, is discussed with relation to the construction of thedocument information retrieval system.
