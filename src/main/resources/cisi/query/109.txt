    It is shown that the mapping of a particular area of science, in thiscase information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis andthe cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their"distances" from each other.  The analysis assumes that the more two authorsare cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw dataare cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social SciencesCitation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows(1) identifiable author groups (akin to "schools") of information science,(2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree ofcentrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities ofauthors within group and across group boundaries ("border authors" who seemto connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors withrespect to the map's axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the mostdivergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis ofauthors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding ofintellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to theextent that those areas rely on serial publications.  The techniqueestablishes authors, as well as documents, as an effective unit inanalyzing subject specialties.
