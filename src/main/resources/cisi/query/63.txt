    A commercially available online search was used as a standard forcomparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information systembased on automatic indexing.

Some common features of thecommercial system, such as online instruction, user-specified print formats,dictionary display, and truncation, are seen to be unnecessary orimpractical for the in-house system.
