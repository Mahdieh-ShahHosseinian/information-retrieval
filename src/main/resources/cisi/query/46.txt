I am seeking information on the use of data processing in libraries andthe mechanization of routine library processes and procedures.  I wouldlike descriptions of both general and specific applications ofautomation in such areas as circulation, cataloging, acquisitions,serial records, and other record-keeping.  Examples should be based onthe operation of a conventional public or university library, orpractices in a special library which could also be applied in a publicor university library.  Give descriptions of equipment and operations,both present and projected.
