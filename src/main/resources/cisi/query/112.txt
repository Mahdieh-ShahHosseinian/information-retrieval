    A fast algorithm is described for comparing the lists of terms representingdocuments in automatic classification experiments.  The speed of the procedurearises from the fact that all of the non-zero-valued coefficicents for a givendocument are identified together, using an inverted file to the terms in thedocument collection.  The complexity and running time of the algorithm arecompared with previously described procedures.
