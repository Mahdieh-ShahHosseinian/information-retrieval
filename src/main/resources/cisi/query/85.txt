    This paper is intended to propose a new methodological approach tothe conception and development of natural language understanding systems.This new contribution is supported by the design, implementation, andexperimentation of DONAU:  a general purpose domain oriented naturallanguage understanding system developed and presently running at the MilanPolytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project.  The system is based on a twolevel modular architecture intended to overcome the lack of flexibility andgenerality often pointed out in many existing systems, and to facilitatethe exchange of results and actual experiences between different projects.The horizontal level allows an independent and parallel development of thesingle segments of the system (syntactic analyser, information extractor,legality controller).  The vertical level ensures the possibility of changing(enlarging or redefining) the definition of the semantic domain on which eachparticular version of the system is oriented and specialized in a simple,incremental, and user-oriented way.  In the paper the general architecture ofthe system and the mode of operation of each segment are illustrated indetail.  Linguistic models, knowledge representation, and parsing algorithmsare described and illustrated by means of selected examples.  Performanceevaluations of the system in the application version on data base inquiry arereported and discussed.  Promising directions for future research are presentedin the conclusions.
