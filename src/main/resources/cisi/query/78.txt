    A generalization of the notion of ATN grammar, called a cascaded ATN(CATN), is prescribed.  CATN's permit a decomposition of complex languageunderstanding behavior into a sequence of cooperating ATN's with separatedomain of responsibility, where each stage (called an ATN transducer)takes its input from the output of the previous stage.  The paper includesan extensive discjussion of the principles of factoring-conceptualfactoring reduces the number of places that a given fact needs to berepresented in a grammar, and hypothesis factoring reduces the numberof distinct hypotheses that have to be considered during parsing.
