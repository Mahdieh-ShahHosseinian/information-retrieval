    One mode of online retrieval in Scisearch or Social Scisearch involvesentering pairs of authors' names believed to be jointly cited bysubsequent writers and retrieving papers in which cocitations occur.  Sixpairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the socialindicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by thefour were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Landwould retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated withpath-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a"general social indicators" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmedexpectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators(SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language intheir titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers ofthe SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generallycited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analyticin nature.  As expected, they were relatively "harder" than the firstgroup of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linkedthrough citations in certain papers.  An additional result is that papersciting at least three of the input authors tend to be overviews of the SImovement.
