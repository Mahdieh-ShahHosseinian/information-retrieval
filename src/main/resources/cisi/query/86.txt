    Approximate matching of strings is reviewed with the aim ofsurveying techniques suitable for finding an item in a database whenthere may be a spelling mistake or other error in the keyword.  Themethods found are classified as either equivalence or similarity problems.Equivalence problems are seen to be readily solved using canonical forms.For similarity problems difference measures are surveyed, with a fulldescription of the well-established dynamic programming method relatingthis to the approach using probabilities and likelihoods.  Searches forapproximate matches in large sets using a difference function are seen tobe an open problem still, though several promising ideas have beensuggested.  Approximate matching (error correction) during parsing isbriefly reviewed.
