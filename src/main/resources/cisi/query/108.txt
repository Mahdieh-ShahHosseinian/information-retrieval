    A technique of online instruction and assistance to bibliographic database searchers called Individualized Instruction for Data Access (IIDA) isbeing developed by Drexel University.  IIDA assists searchers by providingfeedback based on real-time analysis while searches are being performed.Extensive help facilities which draw on this analysis are available tousers.  Much of the project's experimental work, as described elsewhere,is concerned with the process of searching and the behavior of searchers.This paper will largely address itself to the project's computer system, whichis being developed by subcontract with the Franklin Institute's ScienceInformation Services.
