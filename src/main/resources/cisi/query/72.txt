    Passage retrieval (already operational for lawyers) has advantages inoutput form opver references retrieval and is economically feasible.Previous experiments in passage retrieval for scientists have demonstratedrecall and false retrieval rates as good or better than those of presentreference retrieval services.  The present experiment involved a greatervariety of forms of retrieval question.  In addition, search words wereselected independently by two different people for each retrieval question.The search words selected, in combination with the computer procedures usedfor passage retrieval, produced average recall ratios of 72 and 67%,respectively, for the two selectors.  The false retrieval rates were (exceptfor one predictably difficult question) respectively 13 and 10 falselyretrieved sentences per answer-paper retrieved.
