    The Use of a minicomputer in various phases of creating the thesaurusfor the National Information Center for Special Education Materials(NICSEM) database is described.  The minicomputer is used to collect,edit, and correct candidate thesaurus terms.  The use of the minicomputereases the process of grouping terms into files of similar concepts andfacilitates the generation of products useful in vocabulary review and interm structuring.  Syndetic relations, indicated by assigning codedidentification numbers, are altered easily in the design phase to reflectrestructuring requirements.  Because thesaurus terms are already in machine-readable form, it is simple to prepare print programs to provide permuted,alphabetic, hierarchical, and chart formatted term displays.  Overall, theuse of the minicomputer facilitates initial thesaurus entry development byreducing clerical effort, editorial staff decisions, and overall processingtimes.
