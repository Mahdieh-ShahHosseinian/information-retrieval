    This paper describes an architectural approach that provides informationexchange across a broad spectrum of user applications and office automationofferings.  Some of the architectures described herein are currentlyimplemented in existing IBM products.  These and other architectures willprovide the basis for document interchange capability between productssuch as the IBM 5520 Administrative System, the IBM System/370 DistributedOffice Support System (DISOSS), and the IBM Displaywriter System.Specifically described is a document distribution architecture and itsassociated data streams and others.    A general overview of the architectures as opposed to a detailedtechnical description is provided.  The architectures described areprotocols for interchange between application processes; they do notaddress the specific user interface.  The document distributionarchitectures utilize SNA for data transmission and communications controlfacilities.
