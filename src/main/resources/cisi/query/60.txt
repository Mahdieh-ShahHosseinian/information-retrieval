    A linkage similarity measure which takes into account both the bibliographiccoupling of documents and their cocitations (both cited and citing papers)produced improved document retrieval over a measure based only onbibliographic coupling.  The test collection consisted of 1712 papers whoserelevance to specific queries had been judged by users.  To evaluate theeffect of using cocitation data, we calculated for each query two measuresof similarity between each relevant paper and every other paper retrieved.Papers were then sorted by the similarity measures, producing two orderedlists.  We then compared the resulting predictions of relevance, partialrelevance, and non-relevance to the user's evaluations of the same papers.Overall, the change from the bibliographic coupling measure to the linkagesimilarity measure, representing the introduction of cocitation data,resulted in better retrieval performance.
