    This article concerns the problem of how to permit a patron torepresent the relative importance of various index terms in a Booleanrequest while retaining the desirable properties of a Boolean system.The character of classical Boolean systems is reviewed and related to thenotion of fuzzy sets.  The fuzzy set concept then forms the basis of theconcept of a fuzzy request in which weights are assigned to index terms.Ther properties of such a system are discussed, and it is shown that suchsystems retain the manipulability of traditional Boolean requests.
