    It is argued that in information science we have to distinguishphysical, objective, or document space from perspective, subjective, orinformation space.  These two spaces are like maps and landscapes: eachis a systematic distortion of the other.  However, transformation can beeasily made once the two spaces are distinguished.  If the transformationsare omitted we only get unhelpful physical solutions to information problems.
