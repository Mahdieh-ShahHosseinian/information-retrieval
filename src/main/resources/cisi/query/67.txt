    An experimental computer program has been developed to classifydocuments according to the 80 sections and five major section groupings ofChemical Abstracts (CA).  The program uses pattern recognition techniquessupplemented by heuristics.  During the "training" phase, words frompre-classified documents are selected, and the probability of occurrenceof each word in each section of CA is computed and stored in a referencedictionary.  The "classification" phase matches each word of a documenttitle against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the documentusing weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary.  Heuristictechniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, pasttenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classificationphase.  The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis ofchemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influencethe section to which the documents are assigned.  Program performance andhuman consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program resultsagainst the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment withpeople experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.  Theprogram assigned approximately 78% of the documents to the correct majorsection groupings of CA and 67% of the correct sections or cross-referencesat a rate of 100 documents per second.
