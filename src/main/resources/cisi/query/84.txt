    A technique is described for automatic reformulation of booleanqueries.  Based on patron relevance judgements of an initial retrieval,prevalence measures are derived for terms appearing in the retrieved setof documents that reflect a term's distribution among the relevant andnon-relevant documents.  These measures are then used to guide theconstruction of a boolean query for a subsequent retrieval.  To illustratethe technique, a series of tests is described of its application to a smalldata base in an experimental environment.  Results compare favourably withfeedback as employed in a SMART-type system.  MOre extensive testing issuggested to validate the technique.
