Is there any use for traditional classification schemes - DDC, UDC, LC,etc. - in information retrieval systems?  If there is, which schemeappears most suited to machine use and where has it been applied?If there is not, why are these classification schemes irrelevant?Has research shown that a subject classification of knowledge iscompletely unnecessary in machine systems? Or, have new schemesbeen devised which appear to be more suited to machine use?
