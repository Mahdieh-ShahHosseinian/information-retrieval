    Algorithms are given to process partially specified queries in acompressed database system.  The proposed methods handle effectivelyqueries that use either whole words or word fragments as language elements.The methods are compared and critically evaluated in terms of the designand retrieval costs.  The analyses show that the method which exploits theinterdependence of fragments as well as the relevance of fragments torecords in the file has maximum design cost and least retrieval cost.
