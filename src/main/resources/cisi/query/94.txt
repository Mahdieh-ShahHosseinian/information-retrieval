    REFLES is a microcomputer-based system for data retrieval in libraryenvironments.  The problem of information retrieval is discussed from atheoretical point of view, followed by an analysis of the reference processand data thereby gathered, leading to a description of REFLES in terms ofits hardware and software.  REFLES, a prototype system at present, currentlyfunctions in a test environment.  Examples of data contained in the systemand of its use are presented.  Future considerations and speculations onother versions of the system conclude the paper.
