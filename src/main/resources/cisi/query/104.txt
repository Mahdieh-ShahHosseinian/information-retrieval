    This paper tackles the problem of how one might select further search terms,using relevance feedback, given the search terms in the query.  These searchterms are extracted from a maximum spanning tree connecting all the terms in theindex term vocabulary.  A number of different spanning trees are generated froma variety of association measures.  The retrieval effectiveness for thedifferent spanning trees is shown to be approximately the same.  Effectivenessis measured in terms of precision and recall, and the retrieval tests are doneon three different test collections.
