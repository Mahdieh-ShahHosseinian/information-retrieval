    A major deficiency of traditional Boolean systems is their inability torepresent the varying degrees to which a document may be written on a subject.In this article we isolate a number of criteria that should be met by anyBoolean system generalized to have a weighting capability.  It is proven thatonly one weighting rule satisfies these conditions--that associated with fuzzy-set theory--and that this weighting scheme satisfies most of the otherproperties associated with Boolean algebra as well.  Probabilistic weightingis then introduced as an alternative approach and the two systems compared.In the limit of zero/one weights, all systems considered converge totraditional Boolean retrieval.
